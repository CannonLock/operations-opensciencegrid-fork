The MyOSG service runs on hardware at Indiana University and gathers data from several OSG sources including but not limited to: RSV, OIM, BDII, GIP-Validator, and Gratia. MyOSG displays information from many different sources in many different formats. This SLA is inclusive only of selected service used to provide job level decisions or data movement, most notably the XML status based information. A complete list of services presented is in Appendix B.\n\n\nOwners\n\n\nThe MyOSG SLA is owned by OSG Operations Center and Indiana University and will be reviewed and agreed upon by the OSG Executive Team.\n\n\nService Name and Description\n\n\nName\n\n\nGOC Production MyOSG\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe GOC Production MyOSG service presents information from several OSG information sources and presents the information in various forms including web page, Universal Widget API, and XML. The MyOSG service consists of a web server and software consolidators to translate incoming data from several sources to be displayed in MyOSG.\n\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\n\nMyOSG distributes some private contact information based on certificate authentication. It will be subject to Indiana University institutional policy. Direct access to any of the hardware or software will be restricted to OSG Operations staff. Other OSG staff, upon request and GOC review, may be given access to a development version of MyOSG for experimenting with new software, changes in information providers, or for other testing. OSG Operations reserves the right to allow or not allow such requests based on its internal review.\n\n\nService Target Response Priorities and Response Times\n\n\nThis section deals with unplanned outages.
