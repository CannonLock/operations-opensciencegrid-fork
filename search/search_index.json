The service bridges the identity credentials generated by the nation's universities, through the\n\n\nOwners\n\n\nThis SLA is owned by OSG and XSEDE and will be reviewed and agreed upon by the XSEDE Senior Management Team and the OSG Executive Team.\n\n\nService Name and Description\n\n\nName\n\n\nThe CILogon Service\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe CILogon Service provides the certificate signing backend for CILogon Open Science Grid Certification Authority \nCILogon OSG CA\n. OSG OIM interface was integrated with CILogon Hardware Security Module (CILogon HSM) resulting in the new CILogon OSG CA, which is operated by OSG in collaboration with XSEDE. Certificates from this CA are only issued issued if user/host/service certificate request has been approved by the Registration Authority Agent (RA) and/or Grid Admin (as the case may be).\n\n\nThe CILogon Service also provides CILogon Basic CA. The CILogon Basic CA is a service that allows users at universities with existing single sign-on systems to use their campus credentials to get a certificate issued by the CILogon Basic CA instantly. This certificate is only issued if the campus single sign-on system verifies the user's credentials. OSG is a relying party of CILogon Basic CA. Users from some research institutions and universities -which are members of OSG- get certificates from CILogon Basic CA using their institutions credentials.\n\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\n\n\n\nUnavailability of the CILogon Service: certificate signing backend for CILogon OSG CA or CILogon Basic CA does not constitute a security incident.\n\n\nCompromise of the certificate signing backend (offered by CILogon Service) for CILogon OSG CA constitutes a declared security incident at OSG and XSEDE.\n\n\nCompromise of the CILogon Basic CA constitutes a declared security incident only at XSEDE.\n\n\nIncident control in the case of compromise of the CILogon Service will fall to the XSEDE L3 Operations Security lead(s).\n\n\nFor CILogon certificate signing backend, see Section 5.7. Compromise and disaster recovery at CILogon OSG CA Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement (CP/CPS) \nhere\n for incident management and response procedures.\n\n\nFor CILogon Basic CA, see Section 5.7 Compromise and disaster recovery at CILogon Basic CA Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement (CP/CPS) \nhere\n for incident management and response procedures.\n\n\n\n\nService Target Response Priorities and Response Times\n\n\nThis section deals with unplanned outages.

Certificates from this CA are only issued issued if user/host/service certificate request has been approved by the Registration Authority Agent (RA) and/or Grid Admin (as the case may be).  The CILogon Service also provides CILogon Basic CA. The CILogon Basic CA is a service that allows users at universities with existing single sign-on systems to use their campus credentials to get a certificate issued by the CILogon Basic CA instantly. This certificate is only issued if the campus single sign-on system verifies the user's credentials. OSG is a relying party of CILogon Basic CA.

A GlideInWMS factory will be run at UCSD, IU and CERN and provide an integral service of the GlideInWMS system to OSG Stakeholders.\n\n\nOwners\n\n\nThe GlideInWMS SLA is owned by OSG Operations. It will be reviewed by and agreed upon by the OSG Executive Team.\n\n\nService Name and Description\n\n\nName\n\n\nOSG GlideInWMS Factory\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe grid-facing component of the GlideInWMS service available for use by all OSG VOs. The \"factory\" submits pilot jobs through the grid at all sites a VO specifies. This factory removes the need for the VO to directly interact with the OSG's CE service.\n\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\n\nThe VO delegates its proxy to the GlideInWMS factory in order for the factory to submit jobs as the VO itself. This means any critical security incident at the GlideInWMS factory intimately affects the operations of the VO itself.\n\n\nThe GlideInWMS factory service operators are free to share configurations or debugging information from the VO on non-public lists and emails, even if it contains personally identifiable information about the VO's users. If the information is to be presented in a public forum, the GlideInWMS factory service operators need prior permission from the OSG Stakeholders using the WMS Glide-In Factory.\n\n\nThe GlideinWMS factory service operators are free to share summary and/or anonymous data in public forum.\n\n\nService Target Response Priorities and Response Times\n\n\nThis section deals with unplanned outages.

In order to do achieve this, the GlideInWMS Factory operators expects stakeholders to have the following hardware:\n\n\nFor running 1000 jobs, provide a single node with at least two reasonably recent cores and 8GB of memory. Disk space as needed to host the user files.\n\n\nFor 5000 jobs, provide two nodes, one like above to be used for running the schedd, plus another one with at least two modern cores and 4 GB of memory to run the collectors and frontend.\n\n\nFor 10000 jobs, provide two nodes, one with 2 cores and 16GB of memory for the schedd, and another with 2 cores and 8 GB of memory for the collectors and frontend.\n\n\nOSG Operations will be responsible for debugging pilot submission issues at OSG sites. They will be responsible for debugging issues developed by the pilot infrastructure. Their responsibility ends when the job is successfully launched by Condor.\n\n\nOSG Operations will provide best effort assistance for issues pertaining to the VO frontend. The GlideInWMS project, not OSG, is responsible for software bugs.\n\n\nThe GlideinWMS Factory operators will not submit jobs to sites that have not been validated by the VO running the jobs.. In the initial period, the stakeholder is expected to provide the list of validated sites to the GlideinWMS Factory operators. If at one point in time the stakeholder provides validation criteria the GlideinWMS Factory operators can implement, the operators themselves will take over the task of discovering and validating new OSG sites to run pilot jobs on.\n\n\nAffected stakeholders are expected to perform logging and accounting of all jobs run in the previous 30 days for security purposes.\n\n\n\n\nService Measuring and Reporting\n\n\nThe GOC will provide the customer with the following reports in the intervals indicated (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport Name\n\n\nReporting Interval\n\n\nDelivery Method\n\n\nResponsible Party\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem Availability and Reliability\n\n\nMonthly\n\n\nWeb Posting\n\n\nGOC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport of Critical and High Priority Issues\n\n\nQuarterly\n\n\nWeb Posting\n\n\nOSG Operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Changes\n\n\nQuarterly\n\n\nWeb Posting\n\n\nOSG Operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese will be included in Appendix B of this document.\n\n\nSLA Validity Period\n\n\nThis SLA will be in affect for one year.\n\n\nSLA Review Procedure\n\n\nThis SLA will renew automatically on a yearly basis unless change or update is requested by the OSG Operations Coordinator, the OSG Executive Team or the Stakeholders.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAppendix A - Approval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproved By\n\n\nPosition\n\n\nDate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix B - Metric Reports\n\n\n\n\n[[ServiceLevelAgreements#Supporting_Documents][Recent availability statistics]]\n\n\n\n\nAppendix C - VOs Using Glide-In WMS\n\n\n\n\nHCC\n\n\nUSCMS\n\n\nNEBioGrid\n\n\nGLOW\n\n\nGlueX\n\n\nIceCube",

The RPM Software Repository cache service runs on hardware at Indiana University and provides access to latest the OSG CA distribution and OSG Production and ITB software caches in RPM form.\n\n\nOwners\n\n\nThis SLA is owned by OSG Operations Center and Indiana University and will be reviewed and agreed upon by the OSG Executive Team.\n\n\nService Name and Description\n\n\nName\n\n\nOSG RPM Software Repository\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nThe OSG RPM Software Repository hold files necessary to update the OSG CA distribution and current OSG Production and ITB Middleware stacks.

It is the recommended method to install software on the Open Science Grid. It is implemented using CernVM FileSystem (CVMFS) technology.\n\n\nAbout this Document\n\n\nThis document describes the detailed procedures for dealing with CVMFS repositories that are part of the OASIS system but are not hosted at the OSG Global Operations Center (GOC). Rather, they are hosted at the home institution of a Virtual Organization (VO). The procedures include the steps performed by both the GOC and by the repository service administrator. If you are only interested in using an OASIS repository that is hosted at the GOC, see instead [[UpdateOasis]].\n\n\nsee:{\"Documentation/DocumentationTeam/DocConventions\" section=\"Header\"}%\n\n\nsee:{\"Documentation/DocumentationTeam/DocConventions\" section=\"CommandLine\"}%\n\n\nPolicies\n\n\nThese are the policies regarding OSG CVMFS repositories:\n1. The GOC will not host VO-specific CVMFS repositories. This means it will not use its machines to publish files to a repository that is dedicated to a VO. The GOC hosts one and only one repository and that is oasis.opensciencegrid.org.\n1. The GOC will replicate an external repository of a VO or provide access to use oasis.opensciencegrid.org per the existing mechanisms but not both for a given VO.\n1. Quotas on size of repos may be implemented at the discretion of the GOC. A minimum of 100 GB per VO/repo is guaranteed, larger limits may be requested.\n1. The fully qualified repository names of CVMFS repositories distributed to the OSG may be in any domain, but only those in the opensciencegrid.org domain may be requested to be exported to the European grid EGI at this time. There must be one secured master key for all the repositories in a domain. (Although note that the OSG OASIS servers replace that key with their own when distributing non-opensciencegrid.org repositories to OSG sites.)\n\n\nRequirements: setting up a CVMFS repository server\n\n\nThis document doesn't cover requirements for the GOC computers since those are already set up. The requirements for a CVMFS repository server are that it have installed cvmfs-server and cvmfs client, both version 2.2.2 or greater; version 2.3.3 or greater is recommended on EL6 and required on EL7. This requires using aufs or OverlayFS: aufs requires a modified kernel from CERN for Redhat EL6-based systems, and OverlayFS requires at least EL7.3; the latter uses a standard kernel so it is highly recommended. Also an apache httpd server needs to be enabled. NOTE: multiple cvmfs repositories can be hosted on the same machine.\n\n\n/srv/cvmfs will hold all the published data, so make sure it is large enough to hold all the repositories hosted on the machine. /var/spool/cvmfs will hold files during publish, so it should be large enough to hold the most amount of data that might be attempted to be published at once. In addition, on EL7.3 and cvmfs-server-2.3.3 or 2.3.5, /var/spool/cvmfs needs to be of filesystem type 'ext4' or the cvmfs_server command will not allow it. There is a variable to override the filesystem type check, but other filesystem types are not guaranteed to work (ext3 and xfs created with ftype=1 should work with CVMFS_DONT_CHECK_OVERLAYFS_VERSION=yes).\n\n\nThis is a procedure for installing it on a Redhat EL6-based system:\n\n\n[root@client ~]$ rpm -i https://cvmrepo.web.cern.ch/cvmrepo/yum/cvmfs-release-latest.noarch.rpm\n[root@client ~]$ rpm -i https://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.3/osg-3.3-el6-release-latest.rpm\n[root@client ~]$ yum install --enablerepo=cernvm-kernel --disablerepo=cernvm kernel aufs2-util cvmfs-server.x86_64 cvmfs.x86_64 cvmfs-config-osg\n[root@client ~]$ echo \"cvmfs_server mount -a\" >>/etc/rc.local\n[root@client ~]$ reboot\n\n\n\nThis is the procedure for installing on a Redhat EL7.3-based system:\n\n\n[root@client ~]$ rpm -i https://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.3/osg-3.3-el7-release-latest.rpm\n[root@client ~]$ yum install cvmfs-server.x86_64 osg-oasis\n[root@client ~]$ echo \"cvmfs_server mount -a\" >>/etc/rc.local\n\n\n\nIn addition, apache should listen on port 8000, have KeepAlive enabled, and be started. Use commands like these:\n\n\n[root@client ~]$ echo Listen 8000 >>/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.conf\n[root@client ~]$ echo KeepAlive on >>/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.conf\n[root@client ~]$ chkconfig httpd on\n[root@client ~]$ service httpd start\n\n\nMake sure that port 8000 is available to the internet through any firewalls.\n\n\nProcedure to add an externally-hosted repository to OASIS\n\n\n\n\nA VO representative who will have responsibility for the contents of the repository chooses a name for the repository. This name should be the name of the VO or be derived from it (or a project in the VO for the case of the OSG VO), and in a domain that has a secured master key. The recommended domain name for a new repository that originates at an OSG site is opensciencegrid.org. The full name used as an example in this document is \nrepo.domain.name\n. Note: the VO representative's name will be registered in OIM as an OASIS manager for the VO, and names can be added or changed later with GOC tickets. If there is more than one repository for the VO, all the OASIS managers are assumed to be contacts for all the repositories.\n\n\nUsing whatever mechanism is appropriate at their institution, the VO representative requests the local CVMFS repository service administrator to create this repository called =repo.domain.name=.\n\n\nThe repository service administrator creates the repository with these command like these, where ownerid is the user id that will have write access:\n    \n\n    [root@client ~]$ echo -e \"*tt-tnofilett16384\" >>/etc/security/limits.conf\n    [root@client ~]$ ulimit -n 16384\n    [root@client ~]$ cvmfs_server mkfs -o ownerid repo.domain.name\n    [root@client ~]$ echo \"CVMFS_AUTO_TAG=false\" >>/etc/cvmfs/repositories.d/repo.domain.name/server.conf\n    [root@client ~]$ (echo Order deny,allow;echo Deny from all;echo Allow from 127.0.0.1;echo Allow from ::1;echo Allow from  129.79.53.0/24;echo Allow from 2001:18e8:2:6::/56) >/srv/cvmfs/repo.domain.name/.htaccess\n    \n\n    If you might be hosting any hardlinks that span directories (e.g. the git package) and are using aufs (that is, EL6), also do the following:\n    \n\n    [root@client ~]$ echo \"CVMFS_IGNORE_XDIR_HARDLINKS=true\" >>/etc/cvmfs/repositories.d/repo.domain.name/server.conf\n    \n\n    Verify that the repository is readable over http with the following command:\n    \n\n    [root@client ~]$ wget -qO- http://localhost:8000/cvmfs/repo.domain.name/.cvmfswhitelist|cat -v\n    \n\n    That should print several lines including some gibberish at the end.\n\n\nThe repository service administrator next creates a \nGOC ticket\n using the following format:\n    \n\n    Please add a new CVMFS repository to OASIS for VO voname using the URL\n    http://fully.qualified.domain:8000/cvmfs/repo.domain.name\n    by doing step #5 at\n    https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/OasisExternalRepositories\n    The VO responsible manager will be Vorep Name.\n    \n\n    replacing \"voname\" with the VO's name, \"fully.qualified.domain\" with the full name of the repository server, \"repo.domain.name\" with the full name of the repository, and \"Vorep Name\" with the name of the VO representative.\n\n\nThe GOC representative next ensures that the repository service administrator is a valid representative of a host site for the VO. This can be done by (a) the GOC representative already having a relationship with the person or (b) the GOC representative contacting the VO manager to find out. The GOC representative makes sure that the repo.domain.name in the URL is derived from the VO name. Next, on the oasis machine the GOC representative temporarily installs the oasis signing key and runs \nadd_osg_repository\n, giving it as a parameter the given URL. This will download the =.cvmfswhitelist= file from the repository, sign it, publish it back on the oasis http server, and set it to be re-signed every time repository keys are signed (which is about every 20 days). The ticket should remain open because there's another step to do after the next step.\n\n\nIf the repository name matches =\n.opensciencegrid.org= or =\n.osgstorage.org=, the GOC representative responds in the ticket to ask that step #6 be done; all other repositories (such as =\n.egi.eu=) skip this step. The repository service administrator next executes the following commands (replacing repo.opensciencegrid.org with repo.osgstorage.org when needed):\n    \n\n    [root@client ~]$ wget -O /srv/cvmfs/repo.opensciencegrid.org/.cvmfswhitelist       http://oasis.opensciencegrid.org/cvmfs/repo.opensciencegrid.org/.cvmfswhitelist\n    [root@client ~]$ /bin/cp /etc/cvmfs/keys/opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid.org.pub        /etc/cvmfs/keys/repo.opensciencegrid.org.pub\n    \n\n    Next the administrator verifies that a publish operation using the owner's privileges succeeds by making sure there's no errors from the following commands replacing \"ownerid\" with the owner's username:\n    \n\n    [root@client ~]$ su ownerid -c \"cvmfs_server transaction repo.opensciencegrid.org\"\n    [root@client ~]$ su ownerid -c \"cvmfs_server publish repo.opensciencegrid.org\"\n\n    \n\n    If that works then add the wget command to a daily cron:\n    \n\n    [root@client ~]$ echo \"5 4 * \n * ownerid cd /srv/cvmfs/repo.opensciencgrid.org && wget -qO .cvmfswhitelist.new      http://oasis.opensciencegrid.org/cvmfs/repo.opensciencgrid.org/.cvmfswhitelist && mv .cvmfswhitelist.new .cvmfswhitelist\"   >>/etc/cron.d/fetch-cvmfs-whitelist\n    \n\n    Note that this eliminates the need for the repository service administrator to periodically use \"cvmfs_server resign\" to    update .cvmfswhitelist.\n    Then the repository service administrator goes back to the open GOC ticket and asks to proceed to step #7.\n\n\nIf domain.name is a new domain that has not been distributed before, the GOC representative next places a copy of the domain.name.pub public key from domain.name into /srv/etc/keys on both oasis-replica and oasis-replica-itb. If the GOC representative does not have that key, he or she can ask the repository service representative in the ticket how to get it. In addition, in order to support cvmfs client versions 2.2.X (both older and newer clients do not need it), a symbolic link of \n.conf has to be made in /cvmfs/config-osg.opensciencegrid.org/etc/cvmfs/domain.d pointing to default.conf. This symbolic link has to be created on the oasis-itb machine's copy of the config-osg.opensciencegrid.org repository and then copied to production with the copy_config_osg command on the oasis machine.\n\n\nThe GOC representative then adds the URL in OIM under OASIS Repo URLs for the VO. The repository will then be added to the GOC stratum 1 and the FNAL stratum 1 within an hour.\n\n\nThe GOC representative then asks the administrators of the BNL stratum 1 to also add the new repository. He should set up his stratum 1s to read from =http://oasis-replica.opensciencegrid.org:8000/cvmfs/repo.domain.name=. When he has reported back that the replication is ready, the GOC representative reports in the ticket that the repository is ready on the OSG and closes the ticket.\n\n\nThe repository service administrator then gives the VO representative access to the repository under the \"ownerid\" login, informs them of the \nCVMFS documentation on maintaining repositories\n and requests that they adhere to the\n\n\n\n\nEmergency procedure to blank an externally-hosted repository to OASIS\n\n\n\n\nIf there is an emergency request from OSG security to shut down the distribution of a repository, the GOC representative just needs to run \nblank_osg_repository\n on oasis-replica and give it the full name of the repository. This will rename the repository directories to a name with the current timestamp and replace it with a blank repository. It includes a step to run on the oasis machine, and attempts to do it with ssh, but if that fails it prints instructions on how to finish by logging in to the oasis machine manually. That step on the oasis machine requires the signing key to be temporarily installed there.\n\n\nWhen it is time to put the repository back into production, the GOC representative runs \nunblank_osg_repository\n on oasis-replica and gives it the full name of the repository again. This will find the directory with the old timestamp and put it back into service. This step also attempts to ssh to the oasis machine.\n\n\n\n\nProcedure to change the URL of an external repository\n\n\n\n\nThe repository service administrator opens a GOC ticket with the value of the new URL.\n\n\nThe GOC representative then changes the registered value in OIM for the VO in OASIS Repo URLs. The GOC stratum 1 will then be updated within an hour.\n\n\n\n\nProcedure to shut down and remove an external repository\n\n\n\n\nFirst, if the repository has been replicated outside of the U.S., the repository service administrator should open a GGUS ticket asking that the replication be removed from EGI stratum 1s. Wait until they say they are finished before going to the next step.\n\n\nNext, the repository service administrator opens a GOC ticket asking to shut down the repository, giving the repository name, for example =repo.domain.name=, and the VO it belongs to.\n\n\nAfter validating that the ticket submitter is authorized by a registered OASIS manager, the GOC representative next deletes the registered value for =repo.domain.name= in OIM for the VO in OASIS Repo URLs.\n\n\nNext, the GOC representative adds the FNAL and BNL stratum 1 administrators to the ticket to asks them to remove the repository.\n\n\nWhen the FNAL and BNL stratum 1 administrators say they have finished, the GOC representative then runs =cvmfs_server rmfs -f repo.domain.name= and =rm -r /oasissrv/cvmfs/repo.domain.name= on oasis-replica-itb and oasis-replica.\n\n\nFinally, the GOC representative does =rm -r /srv/cvmfs/repo.domain.name= on oasis-itb and oasis.",

The requirements for a CVMFS repository server are that it have installed cvmfs-server and cvmfs client, both version 2.2.2 or greater; version 2.3.3 or greater is recommended on EL6 and required on EL7. This requires using aufs or OverlayFS: aufs requires a modified kernel from CERN for Redhat EL6-based systems, and OverlayFS requires at least EL7.3; the latter uses a standard kernel so it is highly recommended. Also an apache httpd server needs to be enabled. NOTE: multiple cvmfs repositories can be hosted on the same machine.  /srv/cvmfs will hold all the published data, so make sure it is large enough to hold all the repositories hosted on the machine. /var/spool/cvmfs will hold files during publish, so it should be large enough to hold the most amount of data that might be attempted to be published at once. In addition, on EL7.3 and cvmfs-server-2.3.3 or 2.3.5, /var/spool/cvmfs needs to be of filesystem type 'ext4' or the cvmfs_server command will not allow it. There is a variable to override the filesystem type check, but other filesystem types are not guaranteed to work (ext3 and xfs created with ftype=1 should work with CVMFS_DONT_CHECK_OVERLAYFS_VERSION=yes).

            "text": "GlideinWMS Factory Installation\n\n\nThis document describes how to install a Glidein Workflow Managment System (GlideinWMS) Factory instance. \n\n\nThis document assumes expertise with HTCondor and familiarity with the GlideinWMS software.  It \ndoes not\n cover anything but the simplest possible install.   Please consult the \nGlideinWMS reference documentation\n for advanced topics, including non-root, non-RPM-based installation.  In this document the terms glidein and pilot (job) will be used interchangeably.\n\n\n\n\nThis parts covers these primary components of the GlideinWMS system:\n\n\n\n\nWMS Collector / Schedd\n: A set of \ncondor_collector\n and \ncondor_schedd\n processes that allow the submission of pilots to Grid entries.  \n\n\nGlideinWMS Factory\n: The process submitting the pilots when needed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nWe really recommend you to \nuse the OSG provided Factory and not to install your own\n. A \nVO Frontend\n is sufficient to submit your jobs and to decide scheduling policies. And this will avoid for you the complexity to deal directly with grid/cloud sites. If you really need you own Factory be aware that it is a complex component and may require a non trivial maintenance effort.\n\n\n\n\nBefore Starting\n\n\nBefore starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting \nthe Reference section below\n as needed):\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nHost and OS\n\n\n\n\nA host to install the \nGlideinWMS Factory\n (pristine node). \n\n\nCurrently most of our testing has been done on Scientific Linux 6 and 7.\n\n\nRoot access\n\n\n\n\nThe GlideinWMS Factory has the following requirements:\n\n\n\n\nCPU\n: 4-8 cores for a large installation (1 should suffice on a small install)\n\n\nRAM\n: 4-8GB on a large installation (1GB should suffice for small installs)\n\n\nDisk\n:  10GB will be plenty sufficient for all the binaries, config and log files related to GlideinWMS.  If you are a large site with need to keep significant history and logs, you may want to allocate 100GB+ to store long histories.\n\n\n\n\nUsers\n\n\nThe GlideinWMS Factory installation will create the following users unless they are \nalready created\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser\n\n\nDefault uid\n\n\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncondor\n\n\nnone\n\n\nHTCondor user (installed via dependencies).\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngfactory\n\n\nnone\n\n\nThis user runs the GlideinWMS VO factory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo verify that the user \ngfactory\n has \ngfactory\n as primary group check the output of \n\n\nroot@host # \ngetent passwd gfactory \n|\n cut -d: -f4 \n|\n xargs getent group\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be the \ngfactory\n group. \n\n\nCertificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificate\n\n\nUser that owns certificate\n\n\nPath to certificate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHost certificate\n\n\nroot\n\n\n/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem  /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\n are instructions to request a host certificate.\n\n\nThe host \ncertificate/key\n is used for authorization,  however, authorization between the Factory and the GlideinWMS collector is done by file system authentication.\n\n\nNetworking\n\n\nFirewalls\n\n\nIt must be on the public internet, with at least one port open to the world; all worker nodes will load data from this node trough HTTP. Note that worker nodes will also need outbound access in order to access this HTTP port. \n\n\nInstallation Procedure\n\n\nAs with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the host has a \nsupported operating system\n\n\nObtain root access to the host\n\n\nPrepare the \nrequired Yum repositories\n\n\nInstall \nCA certificates\n\n\n\n\nInstalling HTCondor\n\n\nMost required software is installed from the Factory RPM installation. HTCondor is the only exception since there are \nmany different ways to install it\n, using the RPM system or not. \nYou need to have HTCondor installed before installing the GlideinWMS Factory. If yum cannot find a HTCondor RPM, it will install the dummy \nempty-condor\n RPM, assuming that you installed HTCondor using a tarball distribution.\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't have HTCondor already installed, you can install the HTCondor RPM from the OSG repository:\nroot@host # \nyum install condor.x86_64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling HTCondor-BOSCO\n\n\nIf you plan to send jobs using \ndirect batch submission\n (aka BOSCO), then you need also the \ncondor-bosco\n package. You'll have to install the package and remove one of its files \n/etc/condor/config.d/60-campus_factory.config\n because it interferes with the Factory configuration.\n\n\nroot@host # \nyum install condor-bosco\n\nroot@host # \nrm /etc/condor/config.d/60-campus_factory.config\n\nroot@host # \ntouch /etc/condor/config.d/60-campus_factory.config\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall GWMS Factory\n\n\nDownload and install the Factory RPM\n\n\nInstall the RPM and dependencies (be prepared for a lot of dependencies).\n\n\nroot@host # \nyum install glideinwms-factory\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will install the current production release verified and tested by OSG with default HTCondor configuration.\nThis command will install the GlideinWMS Factory, HTCondor, the OSG client, and all the required dependencies.\n\n\nIf you wish to install a different version of GlideinWMS, add the \"--enablerepo\" argument to the command as follows:\n\n\n\n\nyum install --enablerepo=osg-testing glideinwms-factory\n: The most recent production release, still in testing phase.  This will usually match the current tarball version on the \nGlideinWMS home page\n.\n    (The osg-release production version may lag behind the tarball release by a few weeks as it is verified and packaged by OSG).  Note that this will also take the osg-testing versions of all dependencies as well.\n\n\nyum install --enablerepo=osg-upcoming glideinwms-factory\n:  The most recent development series release, ie version 3.3.x release.  This has newer features such as cloud submission support, but is less tested.\n\n\n\n\nDownload HTCondor tarballs\n\n\nYou will need to download HTCondor tarballs for each architecture that \nyou want to deploy pilots on\n.\nAt this point, GlideinWMS factory does not support pulling HTCondor binaries from your system area.\nSuggested is that you put these binaries in \n/var/lib/gwms-factory/condor\n but any \ngfactory\n accessible location should suffice.\n\n\nConfiguration Procedure\n\n\nAfter installing the RPM you need to configure the components of the GlideinWMS Factory:\n\n\n\n\nEdit Factory configuration options\n\n\nEdit HTCondor configuration options\n\n\nCreate a HTCondor grid map file\n\n\nReconfigure and Start Factory\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the Factory\n\n\nThe configuration file is \n/etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml\n.  The next steps will describe each line that you will need to edit for most cases, but you may want to review the whole file to be sure that it is configured correctly.\n\n\nSecurity configuration\n\n\nIn the security section, you will need to provide \neach Frontend\n that is allowed to communicate with the Factory:\n\n\nsecurity key_length=\"2048\" pub_key=\"RSA\" remove_old_cred_age=\"30\" remove_old_cred_freq=\"24\" reuse_oldkey_onstartup_gracetime=\"900\">\n  \n<frontends>\n\n     \n<frontend\n \nidentity=\n\"vofrontend_service@FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME\"\n \nname=\n\"\nORANGE\nvofrontend_sec_name\n\"\n>\n\n        \n<security_classes>\n\n           \n<security_class\n \nname=\n\"\nfrontend_sec_class\n\"\n \nusername=\n\"frontend\"\n \n/>\n\n        \n</security_classes>\n\n     \n</frontend>\n\n  \n</frontends>\n\n\n</security>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese attributes are very important to get exactly right or the Frontend will not be trusted.  This should match one of the \nfactory\n and \nsecurity\n sections of the Frontend configuration \nConfiguring the GlideinWMS Frontend\n in the following way:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis is a snippet from the Frontend configuration (for reference), not the Factory that you are configuring now!\n\n\n\n\nFor the factory section:\n\n\n# from frontend.xml\n\n<factory\n \nquery_expr=\n'((stringListMember(\"VO\", GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)))'\n>\n\n....\n   \n<collectors>\n\n      \n<collector\n \nDN=\n\"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME\"\n \n      \ncomment=\n\"Define factory collector globally for simplicity\"\n            \n      \nfactory_identity=\n\"gfactory@FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME\"\n \n      \nmy_identity=\n\"\nusername\n@FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME\"\n \n      \nnode=\n\"FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME\"\n/>\n\n   \n</collectors>\n\n\n</factory>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the security:\n\n\n# from frontend.xml\n\n<security\n \nclassad_proxy=\n\"/tmp/vo_proxy\"\n \nproxy_DN=\n\"DN of vo_proxy\"\n\n      \nproxy_selection_plugin=\n\"ProxyAll\"\n\n      \nsecurity_name=\n\"The security name, this is used by factory\"\n\n      \nsym_key=\n\"aes_256_cbc\"\n>\n\n      \n<credentials>\n\n         \n<credential\n \nabsfname=\n\"/tmp/pilot_proxy\"\n \nsecurity_class=\n\"frontend\"\n\n         \ntrust_domain=\n\"OSG\"\n \ntype=\n\"grid_proxy\"\n/>\n\n      \n</credentials>\n\n\n</security>\n        \n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the identity of the Frontend must match what HTCondor authenticates the DN of the frontend to.  In \n/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile\n, there must be an entry with \nvofrontend_service\n definition (in this case):\n\n\nGSI \"^\\/DC\\=org\\/DC\\=doegrids\\/OU\\=Services\\/CN\\=Some\\ Name\\ 834323\n$\" \nvofrontend_service\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntry configuration\n\n\nEntries are grid/cloud endpoints (aka Compute Elements, or gatekeepers) that can accept job requests and run pilots (which will run user jobs).\nEach entry needs to be configured to communicate to a specific gatekeeper.\n\n\nAn example test entry is provided in the default GlideinWMS configuration file.  At the very least, you will need to modify the entry line:\n\n\n<entry\n \nname=\n\"\nENTRY_NAME\n\"\n \nenabled=\n\"True\"\n \nauth_method=\n\"grid_proxy\"\n \ntrust_domain=\n\"OSG\"\n \n\ngatekeeper=\n\"\ngatekeeper.domain.tld/jobmanager-type\n\"\n \ngridtype=\n\"gt2\"\n \nrsl=\n\"(queue=default)(jobtype=single)\"\n\n\nschedd_name=\n\"\nschedd_glideins2@FACTORY_HOSTNAME\n\"\n \nverbosity=\n\"std\"\n \nwork_dir=\n\"OSG\"\n>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to modify the entry \nname\n and \ngatekeeper\n.  This will determine the gatekeeper that you access.  Specific gatekeepers often require specific \"rsl\" attributes that determine the job queue that you are submitting to, or other attributes.  Add them in the \nrsl\n attribute.  \n\n\nAlso, be sure to distribute your entries across the various HTCondor schedd work managers to balance load.  To see the available schedd use \ncondor_status -schedd -l | grep Name\n.  \n\n\nSeveral schedd options are configured by default for you:  \nschedd_glideins2, schedd_glideins3, schedd_glideins4, schedd_glideins5\n, as well as the default \nschedd\n. This can be modified in the HTCondor configuration.  Add any specific options, such as limitations on jobs/pilots or glexec/voms requirements in the entry section below the above line. More details are in the \nGlideinWMS Factory configuration guide\n.\n\n\n!!! warning\n      If there is no match between \nauth_metod\n and \ntrust_domain\n of the entry and the \ntype\n and \ntrust_domain\n listed in one of the \ncredentials of one of the Frontends\n using this Factory, then no job can run on that entry.\n\n\nThe Factory must advertise the correct Resource Name of each entry for accounting purposes. Then the Factory must also advertise in the entry all the attributes that will allow to match the query expression used in the Frontends connecting to this Factory (e.g. \n<factory query_expr='((stringListMember(\"\nPINK\nVO\n\", GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)))'>\n as explained in the \nVO frontend configuration document\n ). \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nKeep an eye on this part as we're dealing with singularity.\nThen you must advertise correctly if the site supports \ngLExec\n.\nIf it does not set \nGLEXEC_BIN\n to \nNONE\n, if \ngLExec\n is installed via OSG set it to \nOSG\n, \notherwise set it to the path of gLExec.\n\n\n\n\nFor example this snippet advertises \nGLIDEIN_Supported_VOs\n attribute with the supported VO so that can be used with the query above in the VO frontend and says that the resource does not support gLExec:\n\n\n<entry\n \nname=\n\"RESOURCE_NAME\"\n \n...\n\n   \n<config\n>\n\n   ...\n      \n<attrs>\n\n      ...\n         \n<attr\n \nname=\n\"GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs\"\n \nconst=\n\"True\"\n \nglidein_publish=\n\"True\"\n \njob_publish=\n\"True\"\n \n         \nparameter=\n\"True\"\n \npublish=\n\"True\"\n \ntype=\n\"string\"\n \nvalue=\n\"\nPINK\nVO\n\"\n/>\n\n         \n<attr\n \nname=\n\"GLEXEC_BIN\"\n \nconst=\n\"True\"\n \nglidein_publish=\n\"False\"\n \njob_publish=\n\"False\"\n \nparameter=\n\"True\"\n \n         \npublish=\n\"True\"\n \ntype=\n\"string\"\n \nvalue=\n\"\nNONE\n\"\n/>\n\n         \n<attr\n \nname=\n\"GLIDEIN_Resource_Name\"\n \nconst=\n\"True\"\n \nglidein_publish=\n\"True\"\n \njob_publish=\n\"True\"\n \n       \nparameter=\n\"True\"\n \npublish=\n\"True\"\n \ntype=\n\"string\"\n \nvalue=\n\"\nSiteNameFromOIM\n\"\n/>\n\n     \n</attrs>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSpecially if jobs are sent to OSG resources, it is very important to set the GLIDEIN_Resource_Name and to be consistent with the Resource Name reported in OIM because that name will be used for job accounting in Gratia. It should be the name of the Resource in OIM or the name of the Resource Group (specially if there are many gatekeepers submitting to the same cluster).\n\n\nMore information on options can be found \nhere\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Tarballs\n\n\nEach pilot will download HTCondor binaries from the staging area.  Often, multiple binaries are needed to support various architectures and platforms. \nCurrently, you will need to provide at least one tarball for GlideinWMS to use.  (Using the system binaries is currently not supported).\n\n\nDownload a HTCondor tarball from \nhere\n.  Suggested is to put the binaries in \n/var/lib/gwms-factory/condor\n, but any factory-accessible location will do just fine.\n\n\nOnce you have downloaded the tarball, configure it in \n/etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml\n like in the following:\n\n\n<condor_tarball\n \narch=\n\"default\"\n \nbase_dir=\n\"/var/lib/gwms-factory/condor/condor-8.7.6-x86_64_RedHat6-stripped\"\n \nos=\n\"rhel6\"\n \nversion=\n\"default\"\n/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember also to modify the \ncondor_os\n and \ncondor_arch\n attributes in the entries (the configured Compute Elements) to pick the correct HTCondor binary.\n\nHere\n are more details on using multiple HTCondor binaries. Note that is sufficient to set the \nbase_dir\n; the reconfigure command will prepare the tarball and add it to the XML config file.\n\n\nConfiguring HTCondor\n\n\nThe HTCondor configuration for the Factory is placed in \n/etc/condor/config.d\n.\n\n\n\n\n00_gwms_factory_general.config\n\n\n00-restart_peaceful.config\n\n\n01_gwms_factory_collectors.config\n\n\n02_gwms_factory_schedds.config\n\n\n03_gwms_local.config\n\n\n10-batch_gahp_blahp.config\n\n\n\n\nGet rid of the pre-loaded HTCondor default\n\n\nroot@host # \nrm /etc/condor/config.d/00personal_condor.config\n\nroot@host # \ntouch /etc/condor/config.d/00personal_condor.config\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most installations, the items you need to modify are in \n03_gwms_factory_local.config\n.  The lines you will have to edit are:\n\n\n\n\nCredentials of the machine.  You can either run using a proxy, or a service certificate.  It is recommended to use a host certificate and specify its location in the variables \nGSI_DAEMON_CERT\n and \nGSI_DAEMON_KEY\n.  The host certificate should be owned by \nroot\n and have the correct permissions, 600.\n\n\nHTCondor ids in the form UID.GID (both are integers)\n\n\nHTCondor admin email. Will receive messages when services fail.\n\n\n\n\n#\n-- HTCondor user: condor\n\n\nCONDOR_IDS\n \n=\n\n\n#\n--  Contact (via email) when problems occur\n\n\nCONDOR_ADMIN\n \n=\n\n\n\n############################\n\n\n#\n \nGSI\n \nSecurity\n \nconfig\n\n\n############################\n\n\n#\n-- Grid Certificate directory\n\n\nGSI_DAEMON_TRUSTED_CA_DIR\n=\n \n/\netc\n/\ngrid\n-\nsecurity\n/\ncertificates\n\n\n\n#\n-- Credentials\n\n\nGSI_DAEMON_CERT\n \n=\n  \n/\netc\n/\ngrid\n-\nsecurity\n/\nhostcert\n.\npem\n\n\nGSI_DAEMON_KEY\n  \n=\n  \n/\netc\n/\ngrid\n-\nsecurity\n/\nhostkey\n.\npem\n\n\n\n#\n-- HTCondor mapfile\n\n\nCERTIFICATE_MAPFILE\n=\n \n/\netc\n/\ncondor\n/\ncerts\n/\ncondor_mapfile\n\n\n\n###################################\n\n\n#\n \nWhitelist\n \nof\n \nHTCondor\n \ndaemon\n \nDNs\n\n\n###################################\n\n\n#\nDAEMON_LIST\n \n=\n \nCOLLECTOR\n,\n \nMASTER\n,\n \nNEGOTIATOR\n,\n \nSCHEDD\n,\n \nSTARTD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing other HTCondor RPMs, e.g. UW Madison HTCondor RPM\n\n\nThe above procedure will work if you are using the OSG HTCondor RPMS. You can verify that you used the OSG HTCondor RPM by using \nyum list condor\n. The version name should include \"osg\", e.g. \n8.6.9-1.1.osg34.el7\n.\n\n\nIf you are using the UW Madison HTCondor RPMS, be aware of the following changes:\n\n\n\n\nThis HTCondor RPM uses a file \n/etc/condor/condor_config.local\n to add your local machine slot to the user pool.\n\n\nIf you want to disable this behavior (recommended), you should blank out that file or comment out the line in \n/etc/condor/condor_config\n for LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE. (Make sure that LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR is set to \n/etc/condor/config.d\n)\n\n\nNote that the variable LOCAL_DIR is set differently in UW Madison and OSG RPMs. This should not cause any more problems in the Glideinwms RPMs, but please take note if you use this variable in your job submissions or other customizations.\n\n\n\n\nIn general if you are using a non OSG RPM or if you added custom configuration files for HTCondor please check the order of the configuration files:\n\n\nroot@host # \ncondor_config_val -config\n\nConfiguration source:\n\n\n    /etc/condor/condor_config\n\n\nLocal configuration sources:\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/00-restart_peaceful.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/00_gwms_factory_general.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/01_gwms_factory_collectors.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/02_gwms_factory_schedds.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/03_gwms_local.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/config.d/10-batch_gahp_blahp.config\n\n\n    /etc/condor/condor_config.local\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestarting HTCondor\n\n\nAfter configuring HTCondor, be sure to restart HTCondor:\n\n\nroot@host # \nservice condor restart\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a HTCondor grid mapfile.\n\n\nThe HTCondor grid mapfile \n/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile\n is used for authentication between the glidein running on a remote worker node, and the local collector.  HTCondor uses the mapfile to map certificates to pseudo-users on the local machine.  It is important that you map the DN's of each frontend you are talking to.\n\n\nBelow is an example mapfile, by default found in \n/etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile\n:\n\n\nGSI \"^\\/DC\\=org\\/DC\\=doegrids\\/OU\\=People\\/CN\\=Some\\ Name\\ 123456$\" frontend\n\n\nGSI (.*) anonymous\n\n\nFS (.*) \\1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach frontend needs a line that maps to the user specified in the identity argument in the frontend security section of the Factory configuration.\n\n\nReconfiguring GlideinWMS\n\n\nAfter changing the configuration of GlideinWMS and making sure that Factory is running, use the following table to find the appropriate command for your operating system (run as \nroot\n):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your operating system is...\n\n\nRun the following command...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnterprise Linux 7\n\n\nsystemctl reload gwms-factory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnterprise Linux 6\n\n\nservice gwms-factory reconfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNotice that, in the case of Enterprise Linux 7 \nsystemctl reload gwms-factory\n will work only if:\n- gwms-factory service is running\n- gwms-factory service was started with systemctl\n\n\nOtherwise, you will get the following error in any of the cases:\n\n\n# \nsystemctl reload gwms-factory\n\nJob for gwms-factory.service invalid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrading GlideinWMS\n\n\nBefore you start the Factory service for the first time or after an update of the RPM or after you change GlideinWMS scripts, you should always use the GlideinWMS \"upgrade\" command. To do so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the \ncondor\n and \ngwms-factory\n services are stopped (in EL6 this will be done for you).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssue the upgrade command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Enterprise Linux 7:\n\n\nroot@host # \n/usr/sbin/gwms-factory upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Enterprise Linux 6:\n\n\nroot@host # \nservice gwms-factory upgrade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the \ncondor\n and \ngwms-factory\n services (see next part).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nService Activation and Deactivation\n\n\nTo \nstart the Factory\n you must start also \nHTCondor\n and the \nWeb server\n beside the Factory itself:\n\n\n# \nFor RHEL \n6\n, CentOS \n6\n, and SL6\n\n\nroot@host # \nservice condor start\n\nroot@host # \nservice httpd start\n\nroot@host # \nservice gwms-factory start\n\n\n# \n For RHEL \n7\n, CentOS \n7\n, and SL7\n\n\nroot@host # \nsystemctl start condor\n\nroot@host # \nsystemctl start httpd\n\nroot@host # \nsystemctl start gwms-factory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nOnce you successfully start using the Factory service, anytime you change the \n/etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml\n file you will need to run a reconfig/reload command.

At the very least, you will need to modify the entry line:  <entry   name= \" ENTRY_NAME \"   enabled= \"True\"   auth_method= \"grid_proxy\"   trust_domain= \"OSG\"   gatekeeper= \" gatekeeper.domain.tld/jobmanager-type \"   gridtype= \"gt2\"   rsl= \"(queue=default)(jobtype=single)\"  schedd_name= \" schedd_glideins2@FACTORY_HOSTNAME \"   verbosity= \"std\"   work_dir= \"OSG\" >   You will need to modify the entry  name  and  gatekeeper .  This will determine the gatekeeper that you access.  Specific gatekeepers often require specific \"rsl\" attributes that determine the job queue that you are submitting to, or other attributes.  Add them in the  rsl  attribute.    Also, be sure to distribute your entries across the various HTCondor schedd work managers to balance load.  To see the available schedd use  condor_status -schedd -l | grep Name .    Several schedd options are configured by default for you:   schedd_glideins2, schedd_glideins3, schedd_glideins4, schedd_glideins5 , as well as the default  schedd . This can be modified in the HTCondor configuration.  Add any specific options, such as limitations on jobs/pilots or glexec/voms requirements in the entry section below the above line. More details are in the  GlideinWMS Factory configuration guide .  !!! warning\n      If there is no match between  auth_metod  and  trust_domain  of the entry and the  type  and  trust_domain  listed in one of the  credentials of one of the Frontends  using this Factory, then no job can run on that entry.  The Factory must advertise the correct Resource Name of each entry for accounting purposes. Then the Factory must also advertise in the entry all the attributes that will allow to match the query expression used in the Frontends connecting to this Factory (e.g.  <factory query_expr='((stringListMember(\" PINK VO \", GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)))'>  as explained in the  VO frontend configuration document  ).

For example this snippet advertises  GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs  attribute with the supported VO so that can be used with the query above in the VO frontend and says that the resource does not support gLExec:  <entry   name= \"RESOURCE_NAME\"   ... \n    <config > \n   ...\n       <attrs> \n      ...\n          <attr   name= \"GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs\"   const= \"True\"   glidein_publish= \"True\"   job_publish= \"True\"  \n          parameter= \"True\"   publish= \"True\"   type= \"string\"   value= \" PINK VO \" /> \n          <attr   name= \"GLEXEC_BIN\"   const= \"True\"   glidein_publish= \"False\"   job_publish= \"False\"   parameter= \"True\"  \n          publish= \"True\"   type= \"string\"   value= \" NONE \" /> \n          <attr   name= \"GLIDEIN_Resource_Name\"   const= \"True\"   glidein_publish= \"True\"   job_publish= \"True\"  \n        parameter= \"True\"   publish= \"True\"   type= \"string\"   value= \" SiteNameFromOIM \" /> \n      </attrs>    Note  Specially if jobs are sent to OSG resources, it is very important to set the GLIDEIN_Resource_Name and to be consistent with the Resource Name reported in OIM because that name will be used for job accounting in Gratia. It should be the name of the Resource in OIM or the name of the Resource Group (specially if there are many gatekeepers submitting to the same cluster).

resource, site, facility, or VO?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetiring resources\n\n\nA resource can be disabled in its topology yaml file by setting \nActive: false\n.\nHowever the resource entry should not be immediately deleted from the yaml file.\n\n\nOne reason for this is that the WLCG accounting info configured for resources is used to determine which resources to\nsend APEL numbers for.\nRemoving resources prematurely could prevent resummarized GRACC data from getting sent appropriately.\n\n\nResources that have been inactive for at least two years are eligible to be deleted from the topology database.\nThe GRACC records for this resource can be inspected in \nKibana\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the search bar, enter \nProbeName:*\\:FQDN\n in the search bar, where \nFQDN\n is the FQDN defined for your resource\n\n\nFor example, if your resource FQDN is \ncmsgrid01.hep.wisc.edu\n you would enter \nProbeName:*\\:cmsgrid01.hep.wisc.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the upper-right corner, use the Time Range selection to pick \"Last 2 years\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this criteria selected, Kibana will show you if it has received any records for this resource in the past two\nyears.\n\n\nIf there are no records returned, you may remove the resource from the resource group yaml file in the topology repo.\nAny downtime entries for this resource in the corresponding downtime yaml file for the resource group must be removed\nalso.\nIf you remove the last resource in the resource group yaml file, you should remove the resource group and corresponding\ndowntime yaml files as well.\n\n\nReviewing project PRs\n\n\nNew projects are typically created by the Research Facilitation team.\nHere are a few things to check:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the \"Name\" in the YAML match the file name of the project?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid osg-bot warn about a \"New Organization\"?\n    If so, search around in the projects directory and make sure the \"Organization\" in the YAML\n    is not a typo or alternate spelling for an existing organization.\n    grep around in the \n/projects/\n directory for substrings of the organization.\n    For example, if the new org is \"University of Wisconsin Madison\", do:\n\n\n$ grep -i wisconsin projects/*.yaml\n\n\n\n\n\nand you will see that it's supposed to be \"University of Wisconsin-Madison\".\n\n\nIf the new organization is not a typo or alternate spelling,\ndismiss osg-bot's review with the comment \"new org is legit\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the project name is of the form \n<INSTITUTION>_<PINAME>\n, e.g. \nUWMadison_Parks\n?\n    (This is recommended but not required for new projects.)\n    If so:\n\n\nIs the short name -> organization mapping for the institution in \n/mappings/project_institution.yaml\n\n(e.g. \nUWMadison: \"University of Wisconsin-Madison\"\n)?\nIf not, ask the PR author to add it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the \"FieldOfScience\" in the YAML match one of the keys in \n/mappings/nsfscience.yaml\n?\n    (The
