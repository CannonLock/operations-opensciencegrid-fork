This means that requests to create, rename, remove, or blanking OASIS repositories will come in as GOC tickets. This document contains instructions for handling those tickets. Also see Policy for OSG Mirroring of External CVMFS repositories External OASIS repository Requests to Host a Repository on OASIS Ensure that the repository administrator is valid for the VO. This can be done by (a) OSG already having a relationship with the person or (b) the contacting the VO manager to find out. Also, the person should be listed in the OSG topology contacts list . Review provided URL and verify that it is appropriate for the VO and no other project uses it already. In order to make sure the name in URL is appropriate, check that the name is derived from the VO name or one of its projects. Then, add the repository URL to the topology for given VO under the OASISRepoURLs . This should cause the repository's configuration to be added to the OSG Stratum-0 within 15 minutes after URL is added into the topology. For example, if new URL is for the VO DUNE http://hcc-cvmfs-repo.unl.edu:8000/cvmfs/dune.osgstorage.org edit the following under the OASIS section and create PR: git clone git://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology.git vim topology/virtual-organizations/DUNE.yaml ... OASIS: OASISRepoURLs: - http://hcc-cvmfs-repo.unl.edu:8000/cvmfs/dune.osgstorage.org/ ... When the PR is approved, check on the oasis.opensciencegrid.org host whether the new repository was successfuly signed. There should be message about it in the log file /var/log/oasis/generate_whitelists.log : Tue Sep 25 17:34:02 2018 Running add_osg_repository http://hcc-cvmfs-repo.unl.edu:8000/cvmfs/dune.osgstorage.org dune.osgstorage.org: Signing 7 day whitelist with masterkeycard... done If the respository ends in a new domain name that has not been distributed before, a new domain key will be needed on oasis-replica which should get automatically downloaded from the etc/cvmfs/keys directory in the master branch of the config-repo github repository . There should be a message about downloading it in the log file /var/log/cvmfs/generate_replicas.log . After the key is downloaded the repository should also be automatically added, with messages in the same log file. After the repository is successfully on oasis-replica, in addition you need to update the OSG configuration repository. Make changes in a workspace cloned from the config-repo github repository and use the osg branch (or a branch made from it) in a personal account on oasis-itb . Add a domain configuration in etc/cvmfs/domain.d that's a lot like one of the other imported domains, for example egi.eu.conf . The server urls might be slightly different; use the URLs of the stratum 1s where it is already hosted if there are any, and you can add at least the FNAL and BNL stratum 1s. Copy key(s) for the domain into etc/cvmfs/keys from the master branch, either a single .pub file or a directory, whichever the master branch has. Test all these changes out on the config-osg.opensciencegrid.org repository on oasis-itb using the copy_config_osg command, and configure a test client to read from oasis-itb.opensciencegrid.org instead of oasis.opensciencegrid.org . Then commit those changes into a new branch you made from the osg branch, and make a pull request. Once that PR is approved and merged, log in to the oasis machine and run copy_config_osg as root there to copy from github to the production configuration repository on the oasis machine. If the repository name does not match *.opensciencegrid.org or *.osgstorage.org , skip this step and go on to your next step. If it does match one of those two patterns, then respond to the ticket to tell the administrator to continue with their next step (their step 4). We don't want them to continue before 15 minutes has elapsed after step 2 above, so either wait that much time or tell them the time they may proceed (15 minutes after you updated topology). Then wait until the admin has updated the ticket to indicate that they have completed their step before moving on. Ask the administrator of the BNL stratum 1 John S. De Stefano Jr. to also add the new repository. The BNL Stratum-1 administrator should set the service to read from http://oasis-replica.opensciencegrid.org:8000/cvmfs/<EXAMPLE.OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG> . When the BNL Stratum-1 administrator has reported back that the replication is ready, respond to the requester that the repository is fully replicated on the OSG and close the ticket. Requests to Change the URL of an External Repository If there is a request to change the URL of an external repository, update the registered value in OASISRepoURLs for the respective VO in the topology. Tell the requester that it is ready 15 minutes after topology is updated. Requests to Remove an External Repository After validating that the ticket submitter is authorized by the VO's OASIS manager, delete the registered value for in topology for the VO in OASIS Repo URLs. Verify that it is removed by running the following on any oasis machine to make sure it is missing from the list: print_osg_repos|grep <EXAMPLE.OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG> Add the BNL Stratum-1 operator to the ticket and ask him to remove the repository. Wait for him to finish before proceeding. Run the following command on oasis , oasis-itb , oasis-replica and oasis-replica-itb : remove_osg_repository -f <EXAMPLE.OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG> Immediately add the FNAL Stratum-1 operator to the ticket and ask him to remove the repository as well. This one cannot be done earlier because that Stratum-1 automatically adds all repositories oasis-replica has, but it has to be done within 8 hours or an alarm will start going off. Response to Security Incident on an External Repository If there is a security incident on the publishing machine of an external repository and a publishing key is compromised, the fingerprint of that key should be added to /cvmfs/config-osg.opensciencegrid.org/etc/cvmfs/blacklist . In addition, another line should be added in the form <repository.name NNN with the repository name and a revision number that's one higher than the currently published revision.

A specific SLA exists for each service type; it will list specific services covered by this type, provide a brief description, link to this document, provide specific security considerations, and define service-specific availability metrics. Owners This SLA is owned by OSG Operations and will be reviewed and agreed upon by the OSG Executive Team and service Stakeholders. The ultimate responsibility for abiding to the SLA lies with the OSG Executive Director and Technical Director. Service Target Response Priorities and Response Times This section deals with unplanned outages. Please see Planned Service Changes for information on planned maintenance outages. Severity Description Response Time Resolution Time Escalation Rate High The issue prevents any use of the service Within 4 business hours 2 business days 2 business days Elevated The issue prevents some acceptable uses Within 2 business days 5 business days 5 business days Normal The issue causes degraded performance Within 3 business days 30 business days 30 business days Services generally operate all the time, but support will be within business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) in the timezone of the host institution. The exception is for security incidents. Escalation Procedure Once a service can not be restored within the SLA Resolution Time specified, it automatically escalates. Subsequent levels escalate every period as defined in the Escalation rate in the response table above. Any issue starts at escalation level 1. Escalation Level OSG Contact 1st Service Owner 2nd OSG Operations Coordinator 3rd OSG Technical Director and Executive Director Any ongoing issues will be discussed at the weekly Operations and Production meetings. \"High\" and possibly \"Elevated\" level issues will in addition require more frequent meetings of the appropriate set of people to resolve the issue in a timely manner. Service Availability and Outages The Operations team will strive for monthly availability target percentages as declared in service specific SLAs, where availability is also defined per service. If service availability falls below monthly targets as monitored on two consecutive months, a root cause analysis and service plan will be submitted to the OSG Executive Team. This plan specifies actions to restore the service to the level of availability as specified in the SLA. Off-Hours Support Procedures OSG is presently not structured to commit to provide off-hours support. Accordingly, any off-hours support that may be provided is based on staff going beyond their agreed-upon responsibilities. Planned Service Changes The Operations team reserves the right to change the service based on its needs. No change will occur without notifying Stakeholders at least 5 business days in advance via the operations meeting and the operations email list. This includes both downtimes, as well as changes in functionality that do not substantially change the nature of the service. More substantial changes require more planning and longer lead times. Requests for Service Enhancements Stakeholders may request service enhancements via standard ticketing procedures. It is up to the Operations team to assess the impact of the requested changes and assign appropriate planning and review. Customer Problem Reporting Service problems should be reported immediately by opening a ticket: Either directly at https://support.opensciencegrid.org Or by emailing a description to help@opensciencegrid.org Responsibilities Customer Responsibilities Service customers agree to: Use the service as intended and only for OSG approved work. Alert the Operations team if they are going to use the service in a non-standard way, including testing or anticipated significant increases in usage. Contact the Operations team by means outlined in the Customer Problem Reporting section above if they encounter any service issues. Be willing and available to provide information in a timely manner consistent with the promised Resolution Times listed above. OSG Responsibilities Create and add appropriate documentation for appropriate use of the service. Meet response times associated with the priority assigned to Customer issues. Maintain appropriately trained staff. The OSG and Operations team are not responsible to meet target Resolution Times if a customer does not provide sufficient feedback. Log and track all customer requests for service through the OSG ticketing system. Announce planned changes to stakeholders in accordance with the Planned Service Changes section above and try to minimize adverse effects on stakeholders.

These instance types (discussed below) are: Production, ITB, Development and Utility. Production The availability and maintenance schedule of a production instance is determined by the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the service. The machine name will be derived from the service name with no modifiers other than a number indicating the machine is one of more than one production level instances. An example of a production machine name is \"myosg1.opensciencegrid.org\" ITB An ITB instance will meet the SLA requirements of its corresponding production instance during an announced testing period and not subject to SLA at any other time. Current maintenance policy states a production instance cannot be changed without an announcement and a 1 week testing period. This implies the ITB and production instances of service machines can be modified independently. A service will not have production status unless an ITB instance meeting these criteria exists. Outside periods governed by SLA, modification and availability of an ITB instance is at the discretion of the site operations lead. The period an ITB instance is subject to SLA ends when the proposed change is released to production or it is known the instance has failed testing. Either condition is sufficient to define the end of a testing period. The machine name will be derived from the service name with the modifier \"itb\" and possibly a number indicating the machine is one of more than one ITB level instances. An example of an ITB machine name is \"myosg-itb1.opensciencegrid.org\" Development Development level instances of service machines are optional and at the discretion of the service maintainer/developer. They are never subject to any SLA and may or may not exist at any given time. No instance covered by SLA may depend on any development level machine. The machine name will either not be derived from any service name or will contain a modifier clearly identifying it as \"Development\". An example of a development machine name is \"myosg-dev1.grid.iu.edu\". Utility A utility machine serves a useful function to a service maintainer/developer. If one or more production services depend on a utility instance it shall be covered by the most restrictive SLA of the services dependent on it. An example of a covered utility machine would be the YUM replica machines operated by the GOC. Utility machines not covered by SLA include personal VMs used by staff, \"steige.grid.iu.edu\", for example. A utility machine shall be operated so as to best satisfy the requirements of any dependent services. For example, the YUM replica are stable and contain fixed content except when being updated to facilitate upcoming maintenance of their dependent services. Dependence of service machines on a utility machine may (or may not) be constant in time. Determination of the dependency status of a utility machine shall be at the discretion of the corresponding site operations lead.","title":"OSG Service Types"},{"location":"SLA_bak210126/ServiceTypeDefinition/#osg-service-types","text":"","title":"OSG Service Types"},{"location":"SLA_bak210126/ServiceTypeDefinition/#introduction","text":"This document is to define expectations for various instances of service machines.

Service Name and Description Name The CILogon Service Description The CILogon Service provides the certificate signing backend for CILogon Open Science Grid Certification Authority CILogon OSG CA . OSG OIM interface was integrated with CILogon Hardware Security Module (CILogon HSM) resulting in the new CILogon OSG CA, which is operated by OSG in collaboration with XSEDE. Certificates from this CA are only issued issued if user/host/service certificate request has been approved by the Registration Authority Agent (RA) and/or Grid Admin (as the case may be). The CILogon Service also provides CILogon Basic CA. The CILogon Basic CA is a service that allows users at universities with existing single sign-on systems to use their campus credentials to get a certificate issued by the CILogon Basic CA instantly. This certificate is only issued if the campus single sign-on system verifies the user's credentials. OSG is a relying party of CILogon Basic CA. Users from some research institutions and universities -which are members of OSG- get certificates from CILogon Basic CA using their institutions credentials. Security Considerations Unavailability of the CILogon Service: certificate signing backend for CILogon OSG CA or CILogon Basic CA does not constitute a security incident. Compromise of the certificate signing backend (offered by CILogon Service) for CILogon OSG CA constitutes a declared security incident at OSG and XSEDE. Compromise of the CILogon Basic CA constitutes a declared security incident only at XSEDE. Incident control in the case of compromise of the CILogon Service will fall to the XSEDE L3 Operations Security lead(s). For CILogon certificate signing backend, see Section 5.7.

Executive Summary This SLA is an agreement between OSG and OSG Stakeholders pertaining to the operation of the OSG RabbitMQ message bus. This service allows short, text based messages to be exchanged between OSG operated computers. Anticipated uses include transport of accounting information to GRACC and network performance metrics to perfsonar. An overall service availability of 95% is requested, a level that reflects the current understanding of the frequency of external events causing service failures or degradation. Owners This SLA is owned by IU OSG Operations (IU-OPS). It will be reviewed by and agreed upon by the OSG Executive Team. Service Name and Description Name OSG RabbitMQ Message Bus Description The grid-facing component of this service available for use by all OSG VOs and service providers. Service subscribers access queues to exchange data using point-to-point or publish and subscribe patterns. See the Wikipedia article on message queueing services for further discussion. Security Considerations All data transmitted or received via this service is subject to the terms of the IU privacy policy . In particular all data transmitted to or by the service shall be considered disclosable without condition. Service Target Response Priorities and Response Times This section deals with unplanned outages. Please see Requests for Service Enhancement for information on planned maintenance outages.

Any ongoing \"Normal\" or \"Elevated\" level issues will be discussed at the weekly Operations and Production meetings. Service Availability and Outages The IU-OPS will strive for 95% service availability. If service availability falls below 95% monthly as monitored by IU-OPS a root cause analysis and service plan will be submitted to the OSG stakeholders for plans to restore an acceptable level of service availability. Availability will be determined by IU-OPS using the algorithm documented here . This algorithm is designed to provide early warning of actual failure using current best understanding of the service and experience gained from previous failures. As such IU-OPS may modify it as approprate to relect operational experience. IU-OPS agrees to not modify it to artificially improve the availability measurement. Users must be aware that during maintenance the system may be rebooted and data loss may result. Service Support Hours This service will operate 24x7, but support will be within business hours. The exception is for security incidents. Service Off-Hours Support Procedures All operational issues should be reported as described in the Customer Problem Reporting section. Requests for Service Enhancements IU-OPS will provide enhancement capabilities as they are released by the RabbitMQ project. Requests for customization of the deployed service may be made; IU-OPS has ultimate discretion as to their implementation and deployment schedule but will strive to accomodate requests consistent with available effort and other operational time constraints. IU-OPS will give 1 week of warning prior to any change in the RabbitMQ service version. At any time during this week, Stakeholders are permitted to request a delay for up to 1 week after the originally scheduled upgrade. The exception is for code changes that are deemed critical by IU-OPS staff. A critical change can be deployed immediately if approved by the Production or Operations coordinator. IU-OPS will schedule downtimes and configuration changes during normal business hours unless approved by affected stakeholders. This is done so affected stakeholders are always on-hand in case the downtime or changes cause further issues. Exceptions to this are given in the responsibilities section below. Customer Problem Reporting The IU-OPS provides operators 24x7x365. Message bus related problems should be reported immediately by one of the following mechanisms. Creating a problem ticket at https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/open ( preferred ) Calling the GOC phone at 317-278-9699 Emailing a description to goc@opensciencegrid.org Responsibilities A RabbitMQ service will be run by IU-OPS and made accessible to registered users. Because no computer system is 100% reliable, users must be aware that unscheduled service failure may result in data loss. Users of the service are responsible for backup of any data transferred by the system. Individual users agree to use the system in such a way as to allow reasonable access to others. IU-OPS reserves the right to deploy configuration changes (including access limits) without notice as required to allow reasonable access. IU-OPS will coordinate with user groups during maintenace if so requested by the group. It is the responsibilty of the group to have a representitive available if coordination is requested.

A GlideInWMS factory will be run at UCSD, IU and CERN and provide an integral service of the GlideInWMS system to OSG Stakeholders. Owners The GlideInWMS SLA is owned by OSG Operations. It will be reviewed by and agreed upon by the OSG Executive Team. Service Name and Description Name OSG GlideInWMS Factory Description The grid-facing component of the GlideInWMS service available for use by all OSG VOs. The \"factory\" submits pilot jobs through the grid at all sites a VO specifies. This factory removes the need for the VO to directly interact with the OSG's CE service. Security Considerations The VO delegates its proxy to the GlideInWMS factory in order for the factory to submit jobs as the VO itself. This means any critical security incident at the GlideInWMS factory intimately affects the operations of the VO itself. The GlideInWMS factory service operators are free to share configurations or debugging information from the VO on non-public lists and emails, even if it contains personally identifiable information about the VO's users. If the information is to be presented in a public forum, the GlideInWMS factory service operators need prior permission from the OSG Stakeholders using the WMS Glide-In Factory. The GlideinWMS factory service operators are free to share summary and/or anonymous data in public forum. Service Target Response Priorities and Response Times This section deals with unplanned outages. Please see Requests for Service Enhancement for information on planned maintenance outages.

Detailed information on contacts are viewable on the following MyOSG URL , and are maintained within the Any ongoing \"Normal\" or \"Elevated\" level issues will be discussed at the weekly Operations and Production meetings. Service Availability and Outages The GOC will strive for 90% service availability. If service availability falls below 90% monthly as monitored by the GOC a root cause analysis and service plan will be submitted to the OSG stakeholders for plans to restore an acceptable level of service availability. Reliability and availability will be determined by 2 critical RSV probes and the OSG availability algorithm. * One probe will verify the Condor collector is queryable whenever the host is pingable (i.e., reasonably not a network failure). * The other probe will verify pilots are being submitted to the OSG within 30 minutes of their request. All outages will be logged at least in the OSG ticketing system. Service Support Hours This service will be run for 24x7, but support will primarily be within business hours. The exception is for security incidents. Service Off-Hours Support Procedures All operational issues should be reported as per Customer Problem Reporting section. Requests for Service Enhancements OSG Operations will provide enhancement capabilities only as they are released by the GlideInWMS project. Requests for customization of the deployed service may be made; OSG Operations has the right of up to one month of testing of any change. OSG will give 1 week of warning prior to any change in the GlideInWMS service version. At any time during this week, Stakeholders are permitted to request a delay for up to 1 week after the originally scheduled upgrade. The exception is for code changes that are deemed critical by the GlideinWMS Factory operations staff. A critical change can be put into place after 72 hours of warning or immediately if approved by affected stakeholders. Afterward, OSG Operations will provide a written report detailing the critical change that was made and an analysis of how it will be avoided in the future. Immediately exploitable security-related code fixes can further reduce the above time window to 24 hours. Furthermore, minor code changes that do not affect the semantics of the operations are exempt from the notification requirements. OSG Operations will schedule downtimes and configuration changes during normal business hours unless approved by affected stakeholders. This is done so affected stakeholders are always on-hand in case if the downtime and changes cause further issues. Customer Problem Reporting The GOC provides operators 24x7x365. GlideinWMS Factory related problems should be reported immediately by one of the following mechanisms. Creating a problem ticket at https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/open ( preferred ) Calling the GOC phone at 317-278-9699 Emailing a description to goc@opensciencegrid.org Responsibilities A GlideInWMS Factory will be run by OSG Operations and accessible to the GlideInWMS VO frontend. The Condor pool served by the GlideInWMS Factory will have the ability to scale up to 10,000 running jobs and 100,000 waiting jobs. In order to do achieve this, the GlideInWMS Factory operators expects stakeholders to have the following hardware: For running 1000 jobs, provide a single node with at least two reasonably recent cores and 8GB of memory. Disk space as needed to host the user files. For 5000 jobs, provide two nodes, one like above to be used for running the schedd, plus another one with at least two modern cores and 4 GB of memory to run the collectors and frontend. For 10000 jobs, provide two nodes, one with 2 cores and 16GB of memory for the schedd, and another with 2 cores and 8 GB of memory for the collectors and frontend. OSG Operations will be responsible for debugging pilot submission issues at OSG sites. They will be responsible for debugging issues developed by the pilot infrastructure. Their responsibility ends when the job is successfully launched by Condor. OSG Operations will provide best effort assistance for issues pertaining to the VO frontend. The GlideInWMS project, not OSG, is responsible for software bugs. The GlideinWMS Factory operators will not submit jobs to sites that have not been validated by the VO running the jobs.. In the initial period, the stakeholder is expected to provide the list of validated sites to the GlideinWMS Factory operators. If at one point in time the stakeholder provides validation criteria the GlideinWMS Factory operators can implement, the operators themselves will take over the task of discovering and validating new OSG sites to run pilot jobs on. Affected stakeholders are expected to perform logging and accounting of all jobs run in the previous 30 days for security purposes. Service Measuring and Reporting The GOC will provide the customer with the following reports in the intervals indicated (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually): Report Name Reporting Interval Delivery Method Responsible Party System Availability and Reliability Monthly Web Posting GOC Report of Critical and High Priority Issues Quarterly Web Posting OSG Operations Summary of Changes Quarterly Web Posting OSG Operations These will be included in Appendix B of this document.

This document assumes expertise with HTCondor and familiarity with the GlideinWMS software. It does not cover anything but the simplest possible install. Please consult the GlideinWMS reference documentation for advanced topics, including non-root, non-RPM-based installation. In this document the terms glidein and pilot (job) will be used interchangeably. This parts covers these primary components of the GlideinWMS system: WMS Collector / Schedd : A set of condor_collector and condor_schedd processes that allow the submission of pilots to Grid entries. GlideinWMS Factory : The process submitting the pilots when needed Warning We really recommend you to use the OSG provided Factory and not to install your own . A VO Frontend is sufficient to submit your jobs and to decide scheduling policies. And this will avoid for you the complexity to deal directly with grid/cloud sites. If you really need you own Factory be aware that it is a complex component and may require a non trivial maintenance effort. Before Starting Before starting the installation process, consider the following points (consulting the Reference section below as needed): Requirements Host and OS A host to install the GlideinWMS Factory (pristine node). Currently most of our testing has been done on Scientific Linux 6 and 7. Root access The GlideinWMS Factory has the following requirements: CPU : 4-8 cores for a large installation (1 should suffice on a small install) RAM : 4-8GB on a large installation (1GB should suffice for small installs) Disk : 10GB will be plenty sufficient for all the binaries, config and log files related to GlideinWMS. If you are a large site with need to keep significant history and logs, you may want to allocate 100GB+ to store long histories. Users The GlideinWMS Factory installation will create the following users unless they are already created . User Default uid Comment condor none HTCondor user (installed via dependencies). gfactory none This user runs the GlideinWMS VO factory. To verify that the user gfactory has gfactory as primary group check the output of root@host # getent passwd gfactory | cut -d: -f4 | xargs getent group It should be the gfactory group. Certificates Certificate User that owns certificate Path to certificate Host certificate root /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem Here are instructions to request a host certificate. The host certificate/key is used for authorization, however, authorization between the Factory and the GlideinWMS collector is done by file system authentication. Networking Firewalls It must be on the public internet, with at least one port open to the world; all worker nodes will load data from this node trough HTTP. Note that worker nodes will also need outbound access in order to access this HTTP port. Installation Procedure As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance: Ensure the host has a supported operating system Obtain root access to the host Prepare the required Yum repositories Install CA certificates Installing HTCondor Most required software is installed from the Factory RPM installation. HTCondor is the only exception since there are many different ways to install it , using the RPM system or not. You need to have HTCondor installed before installing the GlideinWMS Factory. If yum cannot find a HTCondor RPM, it will install the dummy empty-condor RPM, assuming that you installed HTCondor using a tarball distribution. If you don't have HTCondor already installed, you can install the HTCondor RPM from the OSG repository: root@host # yum install condor.x86_64 Installing HTCondor-BOSCO If you plan to send jobs using direct batch submission (aka BOSCO), then you need also the condor-bosco package. You'll have to install the package and remove one of its files /etc/condor/config.d/60-campus_factory.config because it interferes with the Factory configuration. root@host # yum install condor-bosco root@host # rm /etc/condor/config.d/60-campus_factory.config root@host # touch /etc/condor/config.d/60-campus_factory.config Install GWMS Factory Download and install the Factory RPM Install the RPM and dependencies (be prepared for a lot of dependencies). root@host # yum install glideinwms-factory This will install the current production release verified and tested by OSG with default HTCondor configuration. This command will install the GlideinWMS Factory, HTCondor, the OSG client, and all the required dependencies. If you wish to install a different version of GlideinWMS, add the \"--enablerepo\" argument to the command as follows: yum install --enablerepo=osg-testing glideinwms-factory : The most recent production release, still in testing phase. This will usually match the current tarball version on the GlideinWMS home page . (The osg-release production version may lag behind the tarball release by a few weeks as it is verified and packaged by OSG). Note that this will also take the osg-testing versions of all dependencies as well. yum install --enablerepo=osg-upcoming glideinwms-factory : The most recent development series release, ie version 3.3.x release. This has newer features such as cloud submission support, but is less tested. Download HTCondor tarballs You will need to download HTCondor tarballs for each architecture that you want to deploy pilots on . At this point, GlideinWMS factory does not support pulling HTCondor binaries from your system area. Suggested is that you put these binaries in /var/lib/gwms-factory/condor but any gfactory accessible location should suffice. Configuration Procedure After installing the RPM you need to configure the components of the GlideinWMS Factory: Edit Factory configuration options Edit HTCondor configuration options Create a HTCondor grid map file Reconfigure and Start Factory Configuring the Factory The configuration file is /etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml . The next steps will describe each line that you will need to edit for most cases, but you may want to review the whole file to be sure that it is configured correctly. Security configuration In the security section, you will need to provide each Frontend that is allowed to communicate with the Factory: security key_length=\"2048\" pub_key=\"RSA\" remove_old_cred_age=\"30\" remove_old_cred_freq=\"24\" reuse_oldkey_onstartup_gracetime=\"900\"> <frontends> <frontend identity= \"vofrontend_service@FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME\" name= \"%ORANGE%vofrontend_sec_name%ENDCOLOR%\" > <security_classes> <security_class name= \"%RED%frontend_sec_class%ENDCOLOR%\" username= \"frontend\" /> </security_classes> </frontend> </frontends> </security> These attributes are very important to get exactly right or the Frontend will not be trusted. This should match one of the factory and security sections of the Frontend configuration Configuring the GlideinWMS Frontend in the following way: Note This is a snippet from the Frontend configuration (for reference), not the Factory that you are configuring now! For the factory section: # from frontend.xml <factory query_expr= '((stringListMember(\"VO\", GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)))' > .... <collectors> <collector DN= \"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME\" comment= \"Define factory collector globally for simplicity\" factory_identity= \"gfactory@FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME\" my_identity= \"%GREEN%username%ENDCOLOR%@FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME\" node= \"FACTORY_COLLECTOR_HOSTNAME\" /> </collectors> </factory> For the security: # from frontend.xml <security classad_proxy= \"/tmp/vo_proxy\" proxy_DN= \"DN of vo_proxy\" proxy_selection_plugin= \"ProxyAll\" security_name= \"The security name, this is used by factory\" sym_key= \"aes_256_cbc\" > <credentials> <credential absfname= \"/tmp/pilot_proxy\" security_class= \"frontend\" trust_domain= \"OSG\" type= \"grid_proxy\" /> </credentials> </security> Note that the identity of the Frontend must match what HTCondor authenticates the DN of the frontend to. In /etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile , there must be an entry with vofrontend_service definition (in this case): GSI \"^\\/DC\\=org\\/DC\\=doegrids\\/OU\\=Services\\/CN\\=Some\\ Name\\ 834323%ENDCOLOR%$\" %GREEN%vofrontend_service%ENDCOLOR% Entry configuration Entries are grid/cloud endpoints (aka Compute Elements, or gatekeepers) that can accept job requests and run pilots (which will run user jobs). Each entry needs to be configured to communicate to a specific gatekeeper. An example test entry is provided in the default GlideinWMS configuration file. At the very least, you will need to modify the entry line: <entry name= \"%RED%ENTRY_NAME%ENDCOLOR%\" enabled= \"True\" auth_method= \"grid_proxy\" trust_domain= \"OSG\" gatekeeper= \"%RED%gatekeeper.domain.tld/jobmanager-type%ENDCOLOR%\" gridtype= \"gt2\" rsl= \"(queue=default)(jobtype=single)\" schedd_name= \"%RED%schedd_glideins2@FACTORY_HOSTNAME%ENDCOLOR%\" verbosity= \"std\" work_dir= \"OSG\" > You will need to modify the entry name and gatekeeper . This will determine the gatekeeper that you access. Specific gatekeepers often require specific \"rsl\" attributes that determine the job queue that you are submitting to, or other attributes. Add them in the rsl attribute. Also, be sure to distribute your entries across the various HTCondor schedd work managers to balance load. To see the available schedd use condor_status -schedd -l | grep Name . Several schedd options are configured by default for you: schedd_glideins2, schedd_glideins3, schedd_glideins4, schedd_glideins5 , as well as the default schedd . This can be modified in the HTCondor configuration. Add any specific options, such as limitations on jobs/pilots or glexec/voms requirements in the entry section below the above line. More details are in the GlideinWMS Factory configuration guide . !!! warning If there is no match between auth_metod and trust_domain of the entry and the type and trust_domain listed in one of the credentials of one of the Frontends using this Factory, then no job can run on that entry. The Factory must advertise the correct Resource Name of each entry for accounting purposes. Then the Factory must also advertise in the entry all the attributes that will allow to match the query expression used in the Frontends connecting to this Factory (e.g. <factory query_expr='((stringListMember(\"%PINK%VO%ENDCOLOR%\", GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)))'> as explained in the VO frontend configuration document ). Note Keep an eye on this part as we're dealing with singularity. Then you must advertise correctly if the site supports gLExec . If it does not set GLEXEC_BIN to NONE , if gLExec is installed via OSG set it to OSG , otherwise set it to the path of gLExec. For example this snippet advertises GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs attribute with the supported VO so that can be used with the query above in the VO frontend and says that the resource does not support gLExec: <entry name= \"RESOURCE_NAME\" ... <config > ... <attrs> ... <attr name= \"GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs\" const= \"True\" glidein_publish= \"True\" job_publish= \"True\" parameter= \"True\" publish= \"True\" type= \"string\" value= \"%PINK%VO%ENDCOLOR%\" /> <attr name= \"GLEXEC_BIN\" const= \"True\" glidein_publish= \"False\" job_publish= \"False\" parameter= \"True\" publish= \"True\" type= \"string\" value= \"%RED%NONE%ENDCOLOR%\" /> <attr name= \"GLIDEIN_Resource_Name\" const= \"True\" glidein_publish= \"True\" job_publish= \"True\" parameter= \"True\" publish= \"True\" type= \"string\" value= \"%RED%SiteNameFromOIM%ENDCOLOR%\" /> </attrs> Note Specially if jobs are sent to OSG resources, it is very important to set the GLIDEIN_Resource_Name and to be consistent with the Resource Name reported in OIM because that name will be used for job accounting in Gratia. It should be the name of the Resource in OIM or the name of the Resource Group (specially if there are many gatekeepers submitting to the same cluster). More information on options can be found here Configuring Tarballs Each pilot will download HTCondor binaries from the staging area. Often, multiple binaries are needed to support various architectures and platforms. Currently, you will need to provide at least one tarball for GlideinWMS to use. (Using the system binaries is currently not supported). Download a HTCondor tarball from here . Suggested is to put the binaries in /var/lib/gwms-factory/condor , but any factory-accessible location will do just fine. Once you have downloaded the tarball, configure it in /etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml like in the following: <condor_tarball arch= \"default\" base_dir= \"/var/lib/gwms-factory/condor/condor-8.7.6-x86_64_RedHat6-stripped\" os= \"rhel6\" version= \"default\" /> Remember also to modify the condor_os and condor_arch attributes in the entries (the configured Compute Elements) to pick the correct HTCondor binary. Here are more details on using multiple HTCondor binaries. Note that is sufficient to set the base_dir ; the reconfigure command will prepare the tarball and add it to the XML config file. Configuring HTCondor The HTCondor configuration for the Factory is placed in /etc/condor/config.d . 00_gwms_factory_general.config 00-restart_peaceful.config 01_gwms_factory_collectors.config 02_gwms_factory_schedds.config 03_gwms_local.config 10-batch_gahp_blahp.config Get rid of the pre-loaded HTCondor default root@host # rm /etc/condor/config.d/00personal_condor.config root@host # touch /etc/condor/config.d/00personal_condor.config For most installations, the items you need to modify are in 03_gwms_factory_local.config . The lines you will have to edit are: Credentials of the machine. You can either run using a proxy, or a service certificate. It is recommended to use a host certificate and specify its location in the variables GSI_DAEMON_CERT and GSI_DAEMON_KEY . The host certificate should be owned by root and have the correct permissions, 600. HTCondor ids in the form UID.GID (both are integers) HTCondor admin email. Will receive messages when services fail. # -- HTCondor user: condor CONDOR_IDS = # -- Contact (via email) when problems occur CONDOR_ADMIN = ############################ # GSI Security config ############################ # -- Grid Certificate directory GSI_DAEMON_TRUSTED_CA_DIR = / etc / grid - security / certificates # -- Credentials GSI_DAEMON_CERT = / etc / grid - security / hostcert . pem GSI_DAEMON_KEY = / etc / grid - security / hostkey . pem # -- HTCondor mapfile CERTIFICATE_MAPFILE = / etc / condor / certs / condor_mapfile ################################### # Whitelist of HTCondor daemon DNs ################################### # DAEMON_LIST = COLLECTOR , MASTER , NEGOTIATOR , SCHEDD , STARTD Using other HTCondor RPMs, e.g. UW Madison HTCondor RPM The above procedure will work if you are using the OSG HTCondor RPMS. You can verify that you used the OSG HTCondor RPM by using yum list condor . The version name should include \"osg\", e.g. 8.6.9-1.1.osg34.el7 . If you are using the UW Madison HTCondor RPMS, be aware of the following changes: This HTCondor RPM uses a file /etc/condor/condor_config.local to add your local machine slot to the user pool. If you want to disable this behavior (recommended), you should blank out that file or comment out the line in /etc/condor/condor_config for LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE. (Make sure that LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR is set to /etc/condor/config.d ) Note that the variable LOCAL_DIR is set differently in UW Madison and OSG RPMs. This should not cause any more problems in the Glideinwms RPMs, but please take note if you use this variable in your job submissions or other customizations. In general if you are using a non OSG RPM or if you added custom configuration files for HTCondor please check the order of the configuration files: root@host # condor_config_val -config Configuration source: /etc/condor/condor_config Local configuration sources: /etc/condor/config.d/00-restart_peaceful.config /etc/condor/config.d/00_gwms_factory_general.config /etc/condor/config.d/01_gwms_factory_collectors.config /etc/condor/config.d/02_gwms_factory_schedds.config /etc/condor/config.d/03_gwms_local.config /etc/condor/config.d/10-batch_gahp_blahp.config /etc/condor/condor_config.local Restarting HTCondor After configuring HTCondor, be sure to restart HTCondor: root@host # service condor restart Create a HTCondor grid mapfile. The HTCondor grid mapfile /etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile is used for authentication between the glidein running on a remote worker node, and the local collector. HTCondor uses the mapfile to map certificates to pseudo-users on the local machine. It is important that you map the DN's of each frontend you are talking to. Below is an example mapfile, by default found in /etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile : GSI \"^\\/DC\\=org\\/DC\\=doegrids\\/OU\\=People\\/CN\\=Some\\ Name\\ 123456$\" frontend GSI (.*) anonymous FS (.*) \\1 Each frontend needs a line that maps to the user specified in the identity argument in the frontend security section of the Factory configuration. Reconfiguring GlideinWMS After changing the configuration of GlideinWMS and making sure that Factory is running, use the following table to find the appropriate command for your operating system (run as root ): If your operating system is... Run the following command... Enterprise Linux 7 systemctl reload gwms-factory Enterprise Linux 6 service gwms-factory reconfig Note Notice that, in the case of Enterprise Linux 7 systemctl reload gwms-factory will work only if: - gwms-factory service is running - gwms-factory service was started with systemctl Otherwise, you will get the following error in any of the cases: # systemctl reload gwms-factory Job for gwms-factory.service invalid. Upgrading GlideinWMS Before you start the Factory service for the first time or after an update of the RPM or after you change GlideinWMS scripts, you should always use the GlideinWMS \"upgrade\" command. To do so: Make sure the condor and gwms-factory services are stopped (in EL6 this will be done for you).

Validating GlideinWMS Factory The complete validation of the Factory is the submission of actual jobs. You can also check that the services are up and running: root@host # condor_status -any MyType TargetType Name glidefactoryclient None 12345_TEST_ENTRY@gfactory_instance@ glideclient None 12345_TEST_ENTRY@gfactory_instance@ glidefactory None TEST_ENTRY@gfactory_instance@ glidefactoryglobal None gfactory_instance@gfactory_ser glideclientglobal None gfactory_instance@gfactory_ser Scheduler None hostname.fnal.gov DaemonMaster None hostname.fnal.gov Negotiator None hostname.fnal.gov Scheduler None schedd_glideins2@hostname Scheduler None schedd_glideins3@hostname Scheduler None schedd_glideins4@hostname Scheduler None schedd_glideins5@hostname Collector None wmscollector_service@hostname You should have one \"glidefactory\" classAd for each entry that you have enabled. If you have already configured the frontends, you will also have one glidefactoryclient and one glideclient classAd for each frontend / entry. You can check also the monitoring Web page: http://YOUR_HOST_FQDN/factory/monitor/ You can also test the local submission of a job to a resource using the test script local_start.sh but you must first install the OSG client tools and generate a proxy. After that you can run the test (replace ENTRY_NAME with the name of one of the entries in /etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml ): Check Web server configuration for the monitoring Verify path and specially the URL for the GlideinWMS files served by your web server: stage base_dir = \"/var/lib/gwms-factory/web-area/stage\" use_symlink = \"True\" web_base_url = \"http://HOSTNAME:PORT/factory/stage\" This will determine the location of your web server . Make sure that the URL is visible. Depending on your firewall or the one of your organization, you may need to change the port here and in the httpd configuration (by modifying the \"Listen\" directive in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf ). Note that web servers are an often an attacked piece of infrastruture, so you may want to go through the Apache configuration in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and disable unneeded modules. Troubleshooting GlideinWMS Factory File Locations File Description File Location Comment Configuration file /etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml Main configuration file Logs /var/log/gwms-factory/server/factory Overall server logs /var/log/gwms-factory/server/entry_NAME Specific entry logs (generally more useful) /var/log/gwms-factory/client Glidein Pilot logs seperated by user and entry Startup script /etc/init.d/gwms-factory Web Directory /var/lib/gwms-factory/web-area Web Base /var/lib/gwms-factory/web-base Working Directory /var/lib/gwms-factory/work-dir/ Increase the log level and change rotation policies You can increase the log level of the frontend. To add a log file with all the log information add the following line with all the message types in the process_log section of /etc/gwms-factory/glideinWMS.xml : <log_retention> <process_logs> <process_log extension= \"all\" max_days= \"7.0\" max_mbytes= \"100.0\" min_days= \"3.0\" msg_types= \"DEBUG,EXCEPTION,INFO,ERROR,ERR\" /> You can also change the rotation policy and choose whether compress the rotated files, all in the same section of the config files: max_bytes is the max size of the log files max_days it will be rotated. compression specifies if rotated files are compressed backup_count is the number of rotated log files kept Further details are in the reference documentation . Failed authentication errors If you get messages such as these in the logs, the Factory does not trust the frontend and will not submit glideins. WARNING: Client fermicloud128-fnal-gov_OSG_gWMSFrontend.main (secid: frontend_name) not in white list. Skipping request This error means that the frontend name in the security section of the Factory does not match the security_name in the frontend. Client fermicloud128-fnal-gov_OSG_gWMSFrontend.main (secid: frontend_name) is not coming from a trusted source; AuthenticatedIdentity vofrontend_condor@fermicloud130.fnal.gov!=vofrontend_factory@fermicloud130.fnal.gov. Skipping for security reasons. This error means that the identity in the security section of the Factory does not match what the /etc/condor/certs/condor_mapfile authenticates the Frontend to in HTCondor (!Authenticated Identity in the classad). Make sure the attributes are correctly lined up as in the Frontend security configuration section above. Glideins start but do not connect to User pool / VO Frontend Check the appropriate job err and out logs in /var/log/gwms-factory/client to see if any errors were reported. Often, this will be a pilot unable to access a web server or with an invalid proxy. Also, verify that the condor_mapfile is correct on the VO Frontend's user pool collector and configuration. Glideins start but fail before running job with error \"Proxy not long lived enough\" If the glideins are running on a resource (entry) but the jobs are not running and the log files in /var/log/gwms-factory/client/user_frontend/glidein_gfactory_instance/ENTRY_NAME report an error like \"Proxy not long lived enough (86096 s left), shortened retire time ...\", then probably the HTCondor RLM on the Compute Element is delegating the proxy and shortening its lifespan. This can be fixed by setting DELEGATE_JOB_GSI_CREDENTIALS = FALSE as suggested in the CE install document .

Each entry needs to be configured to communicate to a specific gatekeeper. An example test entry is provided in the default GlideinWMS configuration file. At the very least, you will need to modify the entry line: <entry name= \"%RED%ENTRY_NAME%ENDCOLOR%\" enabled= \"True\" auth_method= \"grid_proxy\" trust_domain= \"OSG\" gatekeeper= \"%RED%gatekeeper.domain.tld/jobmanager-type%ENDCOLOR%\" gridtype= \"gt2\" rsl= \"(queue=default)(jobtype=single)\" schedd_name= \"%RED%schedd_glideins2@FACTORY_HOSTNAME%ENDCOLOR%\" verbosity= \"std\" work_dir= \"OSG\" > You will need to modify the entry name and gatekeeper . This will determine the gatekeeper that you access. Specific gatekeepers often require specific \"rsl\" attributes that determine the job queue that you are submitting to, or other attributes. Add them in the rsl attribute. Also, be sure to distribute your entries across the various HTCondor schedd work managers to balance load. To see the available schedd use condor_status -schedd -l | grep Name . Several schedd options are configured by default for you: schedd_glideins2, schedd_glideins3, schedd_glideins4, schedd_glideins5 , as well as the default schedd . This can be modified in the HTCondor configuration. Add any specific options, such as limitations on jobs/pilots or glexec/voms requirements in the entry section below the above line. More details are in the GlideinWMS Factory configuration guide . !!! warning If there is no match between auth_metod and trust_domain of the entry and the type and trust_domain listed in one of the credentials of one of the Frontends using this Factory, then no job can run on that entry. The Factory must advertise the correct Resource Name of each entry for accounting purposes. Then the Factory must also advertise in the entry all the attributes that will allow to match the query expression used in the Frontends connecting to this Factory (e.g. <factory query_expr='((stringListMember(\"%PINK%VO%ENDCOLOR%\", GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs)))'> as explained in the VO frontend configuration document ). Note Keep an eye on this part as we're dealing with singularity. Then you must advertise correctly if the site supports gLExec . If it does not set GLEXEC_BIN to NONE , if gLExec is installed via OSG set it to OSG , otherwise set it to the path of gLExec. For example this snippet advertises GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs attribute with the supported VO so that can be used with the query above in the VO frontend and says that the resource does not support gLExec: <entry name= \"RESOURCE_NAME\" ... <config > ... <attrs> ... <attr name= \"GLIDEIN_Supported_VOs\" const= \"True\" glidein_publish= \"True\" job_publish= \"True\" parameter= \"True\" publish= \"True\" type= \"string\" value= \"%PINK%VO%ENDCOLOR%\" /> <attr name= \"GLEXEC_BIN\" const= \"True\" glidein_publish= \"False\" job_publish= \"False\" parameter= \"True\" publish= \"True\" type= \"string\" value= \"%RED%NONE%ENDCOLOR%\" /> <attr name= \"GLIDEIN_Resource_Name\" const= \"True\" glidein_publish= \"True\" job_publish= \"True\" parameter= \"True\" publish= \"True\" type= \"string\" value= \"%RED%SiteNameFromOIM%ENDCOLOR%\" /> </attrs> Note Specially if jobs are sent to OSG resources, it is very important to set the GLIDEIN_Resource_Name and to be consistent with the Resource Name reported in OIM because that name will be used for job accounting in Gratia.

It contains information about the data provided by https://topology.opensciencegrid.org . The topology data for the service is in https://github.com/opensciencegrid/topology , in the projects/ , topology/ , and virtual-organizations/ subdirectories. The contacts data is in https://bitbucket.org/opensciencegrid/contact/ , in contacts.yaml . Topology Data Admins may request changes to data in the topology repo via either a GitHub pull request or a Freshdesk ticket. These changes can be to a project, a VO, or a resource. The registration document and topology README document should tell them how to do that. In the case of a GitHub pull request, you will need to provide IDs using the next_*_id tools in the Topology bin/ dir and potentially fix-up other data. To assist the user, do one of the following, depending on the severity of the fixes required for the PR: For minor issues, submit a \"Comment\" review using GitHub suggestions and ask the user to incorporate your suggestions . For major issues, create a branch based off of their PR, make changes, and submit your own PR that closes the original user's PR. The CI checks should catch most errors but you should still review the YAML changes. Certain things to check are: Do contact names and IDs match what's in the contacts data? (See below for instructions on how to get that information.) If the person is not in the contacts data, you will need to add them before approving the PR. Is the PR submitter authorized to make changes to that project/VO/resource? Can you match them to a person affiliated with that project/VO/site? (The contacts data now includes the GitHub usernames for some people. See below for instructions on how to get that information.) Is their GitHub ID registered in the contact database and are they associated with the relevant resource, site, facility, or VO? Retiring resources A resource can be disabled in its topology yaml file by setting Active: false . However the resource entry should not be immediately deleted from the yaml file. One reason for this is that the WLCG accounting info configured for resources is used to determine which resources to send APEL numbers for. Removing resources prematurely could prevent resummarized GRACC data from getting sent appropriately. Resources that have been inactive for at least two years are eligible to be deleted from the topology database. The GRACC records for this resource can be inspected in Kibana . In the search bar, enter ProbeName:*\\:FQDN in the search bar, where FQDN is the FQDN defined for your resource For example, if your resource FQDN is cmsgrid01.hep.wisc.edu you would enter ProbeName:*\\:cmsgrid01.hep.wisc.edu In the upper-right corner, use the Time Range selection to pick \"Last 2 years\" With this criteria selected, Kibana will show you if it has received any records for this resource in the past two years. If there are no records returned, you may remove the resource from the resource group yaml file in the topology repo. Any downtime entries for this resource in the corresponding downtime yaml file for the resource group must be removed also. If you remove the last resource in the resource group yaml file, you should remove the resource group and corresponding downtime yaml files as well. Reviewing project PRs New projects are typically created by the Research Facilitation team. Here are a few things to check: Does the \"Name\" in the YAML match the file name of the project? Did osg-bot warn about a \"New Organization\"? If so, search around in the projects directory and make sure the \"Organization\" in the YAML is not a typo or alternate spelling for an existing organization. grep around in the /projects/ directory for substrings of the organization. For example, if the new org is \"University of Wisconsin Madison\", do: $ grep -i wisconsin projects/*.yaml and you will see that it's supposed to be \"University of Wisconsin-Madison\". If the new organization is not a typo or alternate spelling, dismiss osg-bot's review with the comment \"new org is legit\". Is the project name is of the form <INSTITUTION>_<PINAME> , e.g. UWMadison_Parks ? (This is recommended but not required for new projects.) If so: Is the short name -> organization mapping for the institution in /mappings/project_institution.yaml (e.g. UWMadison: \"University of Wisconsin-Madison\" )? If not, ask the PR author to add it. Does the \"FieldOfScience\" in the YAML match one of the keys in /mappings/nsfscience.yaml ? (The list is also available on the left column of this CSV .) Is the \"ID\" unique? Is the \"Sponsor\" correct? The sponsor depends on where the users will be submitting jobs from: If they primarily submit from some CI Connect interface such as \"OSG Connect\", use: Sponsor : CampusGrid : Name : <CAMPUS_GRID> The campus grid name must be one of the ones in the /projects/_CAMPUS_GRIDS.yaml file.. Otherwise, the project must be sponsored by a VO: Sponsor : VirtualOrganization : Name : <VO> The VO name must be one of the ones in the /virtual-organizations/ dir. Contacts Data The OSG keeps contact data for administrators and maintainers of OSG resources and VOs for the purpose of distributing security, software, and adminstrative (e.g., OSG All-Hands dates) announcements. Additionally, OSG contacts have the following abilities: View other contacts' information (via HTML and XML ) with a registered certificate Register resource downtimes for resources that they are listed as an administrative contact, if they have a registered GitHub ID Contact data is kept as editable YAML in https://bitbucket.org/opensciencegrid/contact/ , in contacts.yaml . The YAML file contains sensitive information and is only visible to people with access to that repo. Getting access to the contact repo The contacts repo is hosted on BitBucket. You will need an Atlassian account for access to BitBucket. The account you use for OSG JIRA should work. Once you have an account, request access from Brian Lin, Mat Selmeci, or Derek Weitzel. You should then be able to go to https://bitbucket.org/opensciencegrid/contact/ . Using the contact repo BitBucket is similar to GitHub except you don't make a fork of the contact repo, you just clone it to your local machine. This means that any pushes go directly to the main repo instead of your own fork. Danger Don't push to master. For any changes, always create your own branch, push your changes to that branch, then make a pull request. Have someone else review and merge your pull request. All contact data is stored in contacts.yaml . The contact info is keyed by a 40-character hexadecimal ID which was generated from their email address when they were first added. An example entry is: 25357f62c7ab2ae11ddda1efd272bb5435dbfacb : # ^ this is their ID FullName : Example A. User Profile : This is an example user. GitHub : ExampleUser # ContactInformation data requires authorization to view ContactInformation : DNs : - ... IM : ... PrimaryEmail : user@example.net PrimaryPhone : ... When making changes to the contact data, first see if a contact is already in the YAML file. Search the YAML file for their name. Be sure to try variations of their name if you don't find them -- someone may be listed as \"Dave\" or \"David\", or have a middle name or middle initial. Follow the instructions below for adding or updating a contact, as appropriate. Adding a new contact Danger Any new contacts need to have their association with the OSG verified by a known contact within the relevant VO, site, or project. When registering a new contact, first obtain the required contact information . After obtaining this information and verifying their association with the OSG, fill out the values in template-contacts.yaml and add it to contacts.yaml . To get the hash used as the ID, run email-hash on their email address. For example: $ cd contact # this is your local clone of the \"contact\" repo $ bin/email-hash user@example.net 25357f62c7ab2ae11ddda1efd272bb5435dbfacb Then your new entry will look like 25357f62c7ab2ae11ddda1efd272bb5435dbfacb : FullName : Example A. User .... The FullName and Profile fields in the main section, and the PrimaryEmail field in the ContactInformation section are required. The PrimaryEmail field in the ContactInformation section should match the hash that you used for the ID. In addition, if they will be making pull requests against the topology repo, e.g. for updating site information, reporting downtime, or updating project or VO information, obtain their GitHub username and put it in the GitHub field. Editing a contact Once you have found a contact in the YAML file, edit the attributes by hand. If you want to add information that is not present for that contact, look at template-contacts.yaml to find out what the attributes are called. Note The ID of the contact never changes, even if the user's PrimaryEmail changes. Important If you change the contact's FullName , you must make the same change to every place that the contact is mentioned in the topology repo. Get the contact changes merged in first.","title":"Topology and Contacts Data"},{"location":"services/topology-contacts-data/#topology-and-contacts-data","text":"This is internal documentation intended for OSG Operations staff.

Software configuration Configuration for the main app is under /etc/opt/topology/ , in config-production.py and config-itb.py . The webhook app configuration is in config-production-webhook.py and config-itb-webhook.py . The files are in Python format and override default settings in src/webapp/default_config.py in the topology repo. HTTPD configuration is in /etc/httpd ; we use the modules mod_ssl , mod_gridsite , and mod_wsgi . The first two are installed via yum; the .so file for mod_wsgi is located in /opt/topology/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mod_wsgi/server/ or /opt/topology-itb/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mod_wsgi/server/ for the ITB instance. Each of the hostnames are VHosts in the apache configuration. Some special notes: https://map.opensciencegrid.org runs in the same wsgi process as the production topology, but the URL is limited to only the map code. Further, it does not use mod_gridsite so that users are not asked to present a client certificate. VHosts are configured: ServerName topology.opensciencegrid.org ServerAlias my.opensciencegrid.org myosg.opensciencegrid.org Data configuration Configuration is in /etc/opt/topology/config-production.py and config-itb.py ; and config-production-webhook.py and config-itb-webhook.py .

Puppet does not manage the ITB data directories so they need to be updated by hand during testing. GitHub Configuration for Webhook App Go to the webhook settings page on GitHub. There are four webhooks to set up; pull_request and status for both the topology and topology-itb hosts. Payload URL Content type Events to trigger webhook https://topology.opensciencegrid.org/webhook/status application/json Statuses https://topology.opensciencegrid.org/webhook/pull_request application/json Pull requests https://topology-itb.opensciencegrid.org/webhook/status application/json Statuses https://topology-itb.opensciencegrid.org/webhook/pull_request application/json Pull requests For each webhook, \"Secret\" should be a random 40 digit hex string, which should match the contents of the file /etc/opt/topology/github_webhook_secret (the path configured in WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY ). The OSG's dedicated GitHub user for automating pushes is currently osg-bot . This user needs to have write access to the topology repo on GitHub. The ssh public key in /etc/opt/topology/github.pub should be registered with the osg-bot GitHub user. This can be done by logging into GitHub as osg-bot , and adding the new ssh key under the settings page. Required System Packages Currently the webhook app uses the mailx command to send email. If not already installed, install it with: :::console # yum install mailx Testing changes on the ITB instance All changes should be tested on the ITB instance before deploying to production. If you can, test them on your local machine first. These instructions assume that the code has not been merged to master. Update the ITB software installation at /opt/topology-itb and note the current branch: # cd /opt/topology-itb # git fetch --all # git status Check out the branch you are testing. If the target remote is not configured, add it : # git checkout -b <BRANCH> <REMOTE>/<BRANCH NAME> Verify that you are using the intended data associated with the code you are testing: If the data format has changed in an incompatible way, modify /etc/opt/topology/config-itb.py : Backup the ITB configuration file: # cd /etc/opt/topology # cp -p config-itb.py { ,.bak } Change the TOPOLOGY_DATA_DIR and/or CONTACT_DATA_DIR lines to point to a new directories so the previous data does not get overwritten with incompatible data. If you need to use a different branch for the data, switch to it: Check the branch of TOPOLOGY_DATA_DIR from /etc/opt/topology/config-itb.py # cd <TOPOLOGY_DATA_DIR> # git fetch --all # git status Note the previous branch, you will need this later If the target remote is not configured, add it Check out the target branch: # git checkout -b <BRANCH NAME> <REMOTE>/<BRANCH NAME> Pull any upstream changes to ensure that your branch is up to date: # git pull For updates to the webhook app, follow the above instructions for the ITB webhook instance under /opt/topology-itb-webhook and its corresponding config file, /etc/opt/topology/config-itb-webhook.py . Restart httpd : # systemctl restart httpd Test the web interface at https://topology-itb.opensciencegrid.org . Errors and output are in /var/log/httpd/error_log .

In the listing of log files (see above), view the file =update_all_repos.err= In the error log file, look for messages such as: Wed Jan 20 18:10:02 UTC 2016: **Can't acquire lock, is update_all_repos.sh already running?** This message indicates that the most recent update attempt quit early due to the presence of a lock file, most likely from a hung mash process. Look for mash processes: root@host # ps -C mash -o pid,ppid,pgid,start,command PID PPID PGID STARTED COMMAND 24551 24549 23455 Jan 15 /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/mash osg-3.1-el5-release -o 24552 24551 23455 Jan 15 /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/mash osg-3.1-el5-release -o If there are mash processes that started on a previous date or more than 2 hours ago, it is best to remove their corresponding process groups (PGID above): root@host # kill -TERM -23455 Then verify that the old processes are gone using the same ps command as above: root@host # ps -C mash -o pid,ppid,pgid,start,command PID PPID PGID STARTED COMMAND If any part of this process does not look or work as expected: Create a Freshdesk ticket with a subject like \u201cRepo update logs are too old on \u201d and with relevant details in the body Assign the ticket to the \u201cSoftware\u201d group","title":"Identifying and fixing a hung mash process"}]}
