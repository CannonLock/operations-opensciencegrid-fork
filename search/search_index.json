The MyOSG service consists of a web server and software consolidators to translate incoming data from several sources to be displayed in MyOSG.\n\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\n\nMyOSG distributes some private contact information based on certificate authentication. It will be subject to Indiana University institutional policy. Direct access to any of the hardware or software will be restricted to OSG Operations staff. Other OSG staff, upon request and GOC review, may be given access to a development version of MyOSG for experimenting with new software, changes in information providers, or for other testing.
