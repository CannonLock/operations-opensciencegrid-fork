# Operations
## Key Accomplishments and Events

### Service Management Documents 
   * Based on FitSM Service Catalog/Service Portfolio with modifications to keep lightweight.
   * Initially collected Service Management data for Display, GlideIn Factory, GRACC, HostedCE, and OIM. 
   * Draft view at https://github.com/opensciencegrid/operations/blob/master/docs/ServiceManagement/ResponsibilityMatrix.md 
   * Still need to define scope, get security requirements, add authorization for internal content, and make it easier to veiw/navigate. 
   * Looking for more services to add, and input on the current entries. 
   
#### TWiki retirement
   * Also looking at other retirement possibilities.
   
#### Have switched to a flexible maintenance schedule
   * Have not actually used it yet.
   
#### Have adopted some key ideas from FitSM
##### The Configuration Management Database (CMDB)
   * This is not a "lite weight" idea nor is it required/suggested for use elsewhere
      * But lite is a subset of heavy
   * A "Snapshot" of all service configurations is taken before and after any maintenance
   * Here are a few lines from a snapshot:

   * The snapshots are dated and can be compared:

##### Documentation
   * Collecting SLAs under "operations" umbrella 
   
## Perfsonar remains a development level service

## SSO to ITB
   * To announce 16/Jan
