# Operations
## Key Accomplishments and Events
   
#### TWiki retirement
   * Also looking at other retirement possibilities.
   
#### Have switched to a flexible maintenance schedule
   * Have not actually used it yet.
   
#### Have adopted some key ideas from FitSM
##### The Configuration Management Database (CMDB)
   * This is not a "lite weight" idea nor is it required/suggested for use elsewhere
      * But lite is a subset of heavy
   * A "Snapshot" of all service configurations is taken before and after any maintenance
   * Here are a few lines from a snapshot:

   * The snapshots are dated and can be compared:

##### Documentation
   * Collecting SLAs under "operations" umbrella
