## Key Acomplishments and events
### "GOC" is now IU-OPS. I made that up, am not married to it and open to suggestions.
   * Begs the question, how to represent other operational sites here?
   
### Previously reported we were "near capacity"
   * Reporting here on how issues leading to that statement have been addressed.
   
#### Have switched to a flexible maintenance schedule
   * As of 1/Oct/2017 maintenance can occur on any day of the week or week of the month
   * The one week testing period is maintained
   * Internally, there is a strong preference for Tuesday or Wednesday
   
#### All service machines are now built with ansible
   * Last service to be completed was MyOSG
   * All ansible playbooks under version control
   * All ansible playbooks are backed up
   
#### Have adopted a key idea from FitSM
   * The Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is the concept
   * This is not a "lite weight" idea
   * nor is it required/suggested for use elsewhere
   * But lite is a subset of heavy
   * A "Snapshot" of all service configurations is taken before and after any maintenance
   * Here are a few lines from a snapshot:

   * The snapshots are dated and can be compared:

#### Under the hood:
   * 122 real or virtual machines are in the CMDB (Hence the need for the CMDB)
   * All configurations are generated by an automated mechanism
   * This mechanism also implements:
      * Alarm generation (the part than can be generated on the monitored machine)
      * Availability calculation
