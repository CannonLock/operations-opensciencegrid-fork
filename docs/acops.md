## "GOC" is now IU-OPS. I made that up, am not married to it and open to suggestions.
   * Begs the question, how to represent other operational site here?
   
## Previouly I had reported we were "near capacity"
   * Reporting here on how issues leading to that statement have been addressed.
   
## Have switched to a flexible maintenance schedule
   * As of 1/Oct/2017 maintenance can occur on any day of the week or week of the month
   * The one week testing period is maintained
   * Internally, there is a strong preference for Tuesday or Wednesday
   
## All service machines are now built with ansible
   * Last service to be completed was MyOSG
   * All ansible playbooks under version control
   * All ansible playbooks are backed up
   
## Have adopted a key idea from FitSM (discussed below)
   * The Configuration Management Database is the concept
   * This is not a "lite weight" idea
   * nor is it required/suggested for use elsewhere
   * But lite is a subset of heavy
