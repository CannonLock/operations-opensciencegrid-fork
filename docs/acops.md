## Key Acomplishments and Events
### Part of "GOC" is now IU-OPS. I made that up, am not married to it and open to suggestions.
   * Begs the question, how to represent other operational sites here?
   
### Previously reported we were "near capacity"
   * Reporting here on how issues leading to that statement have been addressed.
   
#### Have switched to a flexible maintenance schedule
   * As of 1/Oct/2017 maintenance can occur on any day of the week or week of the month
   * The one week testing period is maintained
   * Internally, there is a strong preference for Tuesday or Wednesday
   
#### All service machines are now built with ansible
   * Last service to be completed was MyOSG
   * All ansible playbooks under version control
   * All ansible playbooks are backed up
   
#### Have adopted some key ideas from FitSM
##### The Configuration Management Database (CMDB)
   * This is not a "lite weight" idea nor is it required/suggested for use elsewhere
      * But lite is a subset of heavy
   * A "Snapshot" of all service configurations is taken before and after any maintenance
   * Here are a few lines from a snapshot:

   * The snapshots are dated and can be compared:

##### Documentation
   * New service HowTo
   * CMDB HowTo
   * The goal is anyone can do anything
   
#### Under the hood:
   * 122 real or virtual machines are in the CMDB (Hence the need for the CMDB)
   * All configurations are generated by an automated mechanism
   * This mechanism also implements:
      * Alarm generation (the part than can be generated on the monitored machine)
      * Availability calculation

## Perfsonar remains a development level service

## Research of SSO and CILogon 2.0 for authentication to Ops services and beyond.
   * Real close to announcing testing to all OSG staff
   * Almost decided to ask here
   
## SLA for the RabbitMQ message bus submitted for comments and approval
