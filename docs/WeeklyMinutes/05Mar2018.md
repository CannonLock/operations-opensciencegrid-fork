####  GRACC operations

   * For now, availibiltiy for GRACC is defined as:
       * HTTPS connection returning status ok of the backend ElasticSearch service
       * HTTPS connection to Grafana service (gracc homepage) returning status ok
       * Check_MK Availability reports 100% for the last week.
       * Availability for Feburary: 99.98%
   * GRACC disk usage went down 96GB to 14.11TB of ~20TB of space.
       * A periodic service deletes old indexes we don't care about.
       * It's possible that some indexes that were big were deleted.
   
   * ITB GRACC is malfunctioning.  Some issue with authentication tokens with RabbitMQ (though, they shouldn't have changed).  Incoming records are 'paused'.
   * Though... not much coming into ITB these days.
