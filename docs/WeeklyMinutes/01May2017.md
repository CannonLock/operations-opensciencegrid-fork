## WLCG & EGI Operations

   * Meeting is tomorrow as today is May Day

## Security
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * Received a report from Bob Ball (MWT2, AGLT2) about some well-known IPS and IDS as TippingPoint and FortiGuard triggering network blockings during any TLS handshake that contains a client grid proxy (RFC3820). These filters aer targeting a vulnerability in GnuTLS library (CVE-2017-5334). This vulnerability is a double-free in GnuTLS; it allows an attacker to bypass security restrictions by presenting a specially crafted X.509 certificate.
