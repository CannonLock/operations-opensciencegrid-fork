## Operations This Week
  
#### Grid Operations Center
   * TWiki to read only 1/Oct, Shutdown 31/Dec
   
On October 1st OSG Operations will begin using a new change management procedure for our services. Instead of releasing changes exclusively on the 2nd and 4th Tuesdays of the month, we will simply announce changes one week in advance and provide a testing window. Releases may occur on any day of the week going forward.

We anticipate this change will allow additional flexibility in responding to change requests and service upgrades. If you encounter (or anticipate) any difficulties associated with this change, please let us know at your earliest convenience.
      
#### WMS Glide In Factory

#### OSG-Connect
   * No planned maintenance
   
#### GRACC operations
   * Debug connections issues with GOC's RabbitMQ.
   * Eliminate sites that do not exist in GRACC (caused by 1 or 2 Gratia probes reporting odd data for hosts)
