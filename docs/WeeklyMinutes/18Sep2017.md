#### GRACC operations
   * Issue with CpuDuration not reported for PBS sites causing zeros in final [APEL report](https://accounting.egi.eu/tier2/country/USA/sumcpu_days/SITE/DATE/2017/3/2017/9/lhc/onlyinfrajobs/); investigated this was one of the hacks previously used in GRATIA which didn't get to GRACC, we're implementing solution asap
   * We had and issue with sending regular APEL reports since Aug 25th; see details in the ticket [here](https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/34901); implementing check_mk to trigger whether our report is being stuck for some reason.

## Operations This Week
  
#### Grid Operations Center
   * ITB release, oasis retry for sure. Others pending.
   
On October 1st OSG Operations will begin using a new change management procedure for our services. Instead of releasing changes exclusively on the 2nd and 4th Tuesdays of the month, we will simply announce changes one week in advance and provide a testing window. Releases may occur on any day of the week going forward.

We anticipate this change will allow additional flexibility in responding to change requests and service upgrades. If you encounter (or anticipate) any difficulties associated with this change, please let us know at your earliest convenience.

   * DCache and General Purpose Grid (GPGrid) are taking a joint extended downtime on Tuesday, Sept. 19 and Wednesday, Sept. 20., that will affect GRACC backups going to FNAL's dCache for the time being.
