<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This SLA is an agreement between OSG Operations at Indiana University and the OSG Management describing details of the MyOSG presentation tools. The MyOSG service runs on hardware at Indiana University and gathers data from several OSG sources including but not limited to: RSV, OIM, BDII, GIP-Validator, and Gratia. MyOSG displays information from many different sources in many different formats. This SLA is inclusive only of selected service used to provide job level decisions or data movement, most notably the XML status based information. A complete list of services presented is in Appendix B.</p>
<h2 id="owners">Owners</h2>
<p>The MyOSG SLA is owned by OSG Operations Center and Indiana University and will be reviewed and agreed upon by the OSG Executive Team.</p>
<h2 id="service-name-and-description">Service Name and Description</h2>
<h3 id="name">Name</h3>
<p>GOC Production MyOSG</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The GOC Production MyOSG service presents information from several OSG information sources and presents the information in various forms including web page, Universal Widget API, and XML. The MyOSG service consists of a web server and software consolidators to translate incoming data from several sources to be displayed in MyOSG.</p>
<h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>
<p>MyOSG distributes some private contact information based on certificate authentication. It will be subject to Indiana University institutional policy. Direct access to any of the hardware or software will be restricted to OSG Operations staff. Other OSG staff, upon request and GOC review, may be given access to a development version of MyOSG for experimenting with new software, changes in information providers, or for other testing. OSG Operations reserves the right to allow or not allow such requests based on its internal review.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/opensciencegrid/production/tree/master/docs/WeeklyMinutes">Production</a> meetings.</p>
<h2 id="service-availability-and-outages">Service Availability and Outages</h2>
<p>The GOC will strive for 99% service availability. If service availability falls below 99% monthly as monitored by the GOC on two consecutive months a root cause analysis and service plan will be submitted to the OSG stakeholders for plans to restore an acceptable level of service availability.</p>
<p>A maximum of two non-scheduled outages will be accepted by OSG during each six month period of service. If the GOC experiences more than the allotted outage, a service plan will be submitted to the OSG stakeholders with plans to restore the service to an acceptable level of operations.</p>
<h2 id="service-support-hours">Service Support Hours</h2>
<p>The MyOSG service is supported 24x7 by the GOC and Indiana University. Critical and High level issues will result in response within (1) hour. All other issues will be investigated by the next business day.</p>
<h2 id="service-off-hours-support-procedures">Service Off-Hours Support Procedures</h2>
<p>All MyOSG issues should be reported to the GOC immediately by <a href="http://ticket.grid.iu.edu">trouble ticket</a> web submission. If the problem is deemed critical, a GOC staff member will be alerted immediately.</p>
<h2 id="requests-for-service-enhancement">Requests for Service Enhancement</h2>
<p>This section deals with planned maintenance outages. Please see <a href="#service-target-response-priorities-and-response-times">Service Target Response Priorities and Response Times</a> for information on unplanned outages.</p>
<p>The OSG Operations will respond to customer requests for service enhancements based on GOC determination of the necessity and desirability of the enhancement. No alteration or deletions will be brought to the production MyOSG without a minimum of ten (10) business days of testing. New human-interface features or new machine readable interfaces may be brought to production with five (5) business days of testing from the feature requester. The GOC reserves the right to enhance the physical environment of the service based on IU and GOC needs. No enhancement will occur without advanced notice to the OSG community.</p>
<h2 id="customer-problem-reporting">Customer Problem Reporting</h2>
<p>The GOC provides operators 24x7x365. MyOSG problems should be reported immediately by one of the following mechanisms.</p>
